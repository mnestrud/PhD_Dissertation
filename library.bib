@article{Fechner1987,
abstract = {The paper presents a translation of Appendix 2 of the second volume of Fechner's Zend-Avesta (1851), which contains the first outline of psychophysics as the quantitative science of mind-body relations. Fechner argues that mathematical psychology must be based on observation of physical phenomena, because observation of mental phenomena results in equality judgments only. The logarithmic formula is not yet based on Weber's law, but on various observations showing that mental intensities increase at a slower rate than the corresponding physical intensities. The physical substrate of mental phenomena is oscillatory and can be decomposed into a main wave and “ripples” superimposed on it, a conception which is illustrated by attentional phenomena and by sleeping and waking. The notion of negative sensations is introduced and discussed. A variant of the logarithmic law is proposed for higher mental activities. Throughout, Fechner's main concern is with what he called “inner psychophysics” in his later writings.},

abstract = {Iron and copper salts have complex olfactory and gustatory properties including a metallic flavor component that is decreased by nasal occlusion. To examine the sensory properties of ferrous sulfate and copper sulfate, a trained descriptive panel evaluated these compounds at equal molarity and perceived equal intensity with and without nasal occlusion. Ferrous sulfate exhibited a metallic taste and metallic aftertaste and copper sulfate exhibited a more pronounced metallic aftertaste. Metallic sensations were decreased by nasal occlusion, which in the absence of any orthonasal metallic smell, implies that the sensations were retronasally perceived volatiles in the nose open condition. Ferrous sulfate showed a larger effect of nasal occlusion. A second experiment isolated ferrous sulfate solutions from oral contact via a plastic barrier. In comparison to a condition in which oral contact was allowed, intensity ratings were decreased. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that rinses with solutions of metal salts, particularly ferrous sulfate, generate volatile lipid oxidation products in the mouth that are perceived retronasally as metallic flavors.},

In the present study, we sought to explore ways of dealing with the complex volume of data created when studying meals and food choice using a mixture of correspondence, cluster, and discriminate analysis. The study illustrates the utility of this approach for dealing with complex data and the analysis reveals the complexity between eating occasions, location and food choice.},

Included are considerations that have to be made before starting an analysis, how to handle different dimensionalities of data, when to consider fitting scaling factors and when not to, and the distinction between the number of dimensions that are needed to give an adequate fit and the number of dimensions needed for graphical representation. The distinction between signal and noise plays an important part in explaining how different methods are suitable for exploring different aspects of the data, rather than being viewed as competing methods with the same general objectives. Explanations are largely set in a geometrical context, thus keeping technical mathematics to a minimum; a common Analysis of Variance framework allows all the methods to be considered in a unified way and suggests some new ways in which these kinds of data may be analysed. The whole is illustrated by example analyses.},

abstract = {Garlic s pungent flavor has made it a popular ingredient in cuisines around the world and throughout history. Garlic s health benefits have been elevated from folklore to clinical study [1 5]. Although there is some controversy as to the efficacy of garlic, garlic products are one of the most popular herbal supplements in the U.S. [6]. Chemically complex, garlic contains different assortments of sulfur compounds depending on whether the cloves are intact, crushed, cooked, or raw [7]. Raw garlic, when cut and placed on the tongue or lips, elicits painful burning and prickling sensations through unknown mechanisms. Here, we show that raw but not baked garlic activates TRPA1 and TRPV1, two temperature-activated ion channels that belong to the transient receptor potential (TRP) family [8 12]. These thermoTRPs are present in the pain-sensing neurons that innervate the mouth. We further show that allicin, an unstable component of fresh garlic, is the chemical responsible for TRPA1 and TRPV1 activation and is therefore likely to cause garlic s pungency.},

abstract = {A Free Choice Profiling test was carried out to find out whether assessors with a basic sensory knowledge are able to characterise flavour and odour of orange-based lemonades. The experiment was run with eight different samples of orange-based soft drinks in four replicates. Generalized Procrustes Analysis combined with Principal Component Analysis were used to analyse and plot the data. The analysis of the four separate replicates showed, that the assessors were not able to reproduce their description of the sensory characteristics suitably, there were relatively large differences between the assessments of the same products by the same assessors in the different replicates. Even for this data, however, the permutation test showed a highly significant group average configuration. This was mainly due to differences between the replicates. But a large residual variance remained. Only about 30\% of the variability could be explained by the group average configuration, and only about 12\% of the total variance could be explained by the first two dimensions of it. When the four assessments of each product were averaged to stabilize the data, 60\% of the total variance could be explained by the group average configuration and the first two dimensions of it could explain 30\% of the total variability. Therefore, at least a coarse interpretation of the consensus space could be made. Our general finding was that profiling of orange-based lemonades by nearly untrained assessors appears to be useful but should be considered with some reserve. It seems that the differences between the products were too subtle for a reproducible profiling by these methods. However, some interpretable results on the structure of the products and on the variables could be gained.},

@article{Luce1964,
abstract = {The essential character of what is classically considered, e.g., by N. R. Campbell, the fundamental measurement of extensive quantities is described by an axiomatization for the comparision of effects of (or responses to) arbitrary combinations of “quantities” of a single specified kind. For example, the effect of placing one arbitrary combination of masses on a pan of a beam balance is compared with another arbitrary combination on the other pan. Measurement on a ratio scale follows from such axioms. In this paper, the essential character of simultaneous conjoint measurement is described by an axiomatization for the comparision of effects of (or responses to) pairs formed from two specified kinds of “quantities”. The axioms apply when, for example, the effect of a pair consisting of one mass and one difference in gravitational potential on a device that responds to momentum is compared with the effect of another such pair. Measurement on interval scales which have a common unit follows from these axioms; usually these scales can be converted in a natural way into ratio scales. A close relation exists between conjoint measurement and the establishment of response measures in a two-way table, or other analysis-of-variance situations, for which the “effects of columns” and the “effects of rows” are additive. Indeed, the discovery of such measures, which are well known to have important practical advantages, may be viewed as the discovery, via conjoint measurement, of fundamental measures of the row and column variables. From this point of view it is natural to regard conjoint measurement as factorial measurement.},

abstract = {Recently there has been renewed interest in the use of projective mapping to evaluate overall product similarity. Previous studies show a high degree of similarity between product maps from projective mapping and descriptive analysis techniques; however, trained panels had been used in these studies. In this study, three groups of untrained panelists performed projective mapping on a set of chocolates and then were trained and performed descriptive analysis. Principal component analysis and multifactor analysis were used to generate product maps of the descriptive analysis and projective mapping data, respectively. All six maps were visually similar, and RV-coefficients between the six data sets were greater than 0.8. The results indicate that the use of untrained judges for the projective mapping provided equivalent product spaces as obtained by descriptive analysis for this set of products. Furthermore, the similarity among panels indicates that overall the panelists perceived the chocolates in a similar manner. The current study indicates that projective mapping can provide equivalent product maps to those obtained by descriptive analysis. On its own, projective mapping presents an efficient method to obtain overall product differences from consumers or trained judges. In combination with a descriptive technique, projective mapping performed by consumers can provide insight as to which attributes are most important to consumers in determining product differences.},

The objective of this study was to determine the variation on the relative sweetness of aspartame (APM), stevia [Stevia rebaudiana (Bert.) Bertoni] leaf extract (SrB) and the mixture cyclamate/saccharin – two parts of cyclamate and one part of saccharin – (C/S) with the increase in their concentrations, and in neutral and acid pH in equi-sweet concentration to 10\% sucrose, using magnitude estimation. Sweetness equivalence of SrB in relation to sucrose concentrations of 20\% or higher and of APM and C/S to sucrose concentrations of 40\% or higher could not be determined, because a bitter taste predominated. The potency of all sweeteners decreased as the level of sweetner increased. In equi-sweet concentration of sucrose at 10\%, with pH 7.0 and pH 3.0, the potency was practically the same for all sweeteners evaluated.},

abstract = {SUMMARY1. We analysed an existing database of macroinvertebrates and fish in the context of a newly established geographical information system (GIS) of physical features to determine the relationships between stream community composition and physical factors measured at three landscape scales 2013 catchment, reach and bedform. Both an exploratory (concordance analysis) and a predictive (ausrivas) approach were used. 2. The environmental variables that most successfully accounted for variation in macroinvertebrate assemblages were mainly 'natural' and at the catchment-scale (relief ratio, basin diameter, etc.) but the human-induced physical setting of percentage of pasture in the riparian zone was also influential. For fish, 'natural' variables were also dominant, but these were mostly at the bedform or reach scales and land use featured strongly. 3. Geographic location accounted for some of the variation in invertebrate assemblages, partly because geography and influential conditions/resources are correlated but also because different species may have evolved in different places and have not colonised every 'ecologically appropriate' location. Geographic location was not influential in accounting for variation in assemblages of strongly flying invertebrates, supporting the hypothesis that organisms having high dispersal potential can be expected to break down geographic barriers more readily than those with poor dispersal powers. In accord with what is known about the local evolution and restricted distributions of native and exotic species, history (reflected in geography) appeared to account for some variation in fish assemblages. 4. Given their different mathematical bases, the fact that exploratory and predictive analyses yielded similar results provides added confidence to our conclusions.},

Panelists evaluated sensory heat intensity over a 3-min interval. Time-intensity parameters (maximum intensity-MAX, time to maximum intensity-TMAX, and rate of release-RATE) were evaluated. Overall, intensity scores increased as capsaicin concentration increased. The increase was related to carrier and fat level. Water samples (0.4, 0.8, and 1.3 ppm) were perceived as more intense than cheese or starch samples at the same capsaicin level. Generally, increasing the fat level resulted in lower intensity scores. Warming samples increased RATE, the only parameter affected by temperature. The training method was effective when water was the carrier. However, physical or chemical interactions that occur in simple food systems may influence perceived pungency.},

abstract = {This paper presents a method for modelling and monitoring the individual decision process of wine tasting panellists. The individual decision of approving or rejecting a wine is based on the panellist's evaluation of the wine characteristics. The decision process is modelled through a logistic regression where the dependent variable is the decision itself (rejected-0 or approved-1) and the independent variables are the characteristics that were considered relevant for the wine evaluation. The process is monitored using a CUSUM control chart for binomial proportions. The control chart variable is the number of disagreements observed (in a sample of size N) between the actual decisions of the panellist and the results anticipated by the logistic regression model. The method was tested in the Port Wine Institute. Such a test revealed that the logistic model is a useful tool for clarifying both the way in which the wine evaluation process is carried out, and how the decisions are taken. Furthermore, the test has also showed that the control chart is responsive to significant changes of the individual decision process.},

abstract = {Laboratory studies have shown that the resistance of isolated LDL-cholesterol or linoleic acid to oxidation is increased in incubations with chilli extracts or capsaicin – the active ingredient of chilli. It is unknown if these in vitro antioxidative effects also occur in the serum of individuals eating chilli regularly. The present study investigated the effects of regular consumption of chilli on in vitro serum lipoprotein oxidation and total antioxidant status (TAS) in healthy adult men and women. In a randomised cross-over study, twenty-seven participants (thirteen men and fourteen women) ate ‘freshly chopped chilli’ blend (30g/d; 55\% cayenne chilli) and no chilli (bland) diets, for 4 weeks each. Use of other spices, such as cinnamon, ginger, garlic and mustard, was restricted to minimum amounts. At the end of each dietary period serum samples were analysed for lipids, lipoproteins, TAS and Cu-induced lipoprotein oxidation. Lag time (before initiation of oxidation) and rate of oxidation (slope of propagation phase) were calculated. There was no difference in the serum lipid, lipoproteins and TAS at the end of the two dietary periods. In the whole group, the rate of oxidation was significantly lower (mean difference −0·23 absorbance ×10−3/min; P=0·04) after the chilli diet, compared with the bland diet. In women, lag time was higher (mean difference 9·61min; P<0·001) after the chilli diet, compared with the bland diet. In conclusion, regular consumption of chilli for 4 weeks increases the resistance of serum lipoproteins to oxidation.},

@article{Faye2006,
abstract = {The purpose of this study is to develop an alternative to external preference mapping through the completion of two consumer test phases: a preference scaling and a perceptual free sorting followed by a verbal description. The stimuli are 18 leather samples varying in relief, origin and treatment. 207 na\"{\i}ve consumers are asked to group the samples according to their visual and tactile likeness and then to freely describe each of the constituted groups. Preference is collected using a hedonic scale for each individual leather. Half the consumers perform the preference step before the free sorting task and half perform the free sorting task first. Consumer words are plotted onto Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) maps in order to explain the perceptual dimensions. Besides these consumer tests, a sensory profiling is conducted with an expert panel for methodological comparison. Then, external preference mapping is carried out using the consumer perceptive maps on the one hand and the sensory profile on the other hand. The MDS positioning of the leather samples by consumers is comparable to the sensory one of the experts. In addition, consumer words give a pertinent explanation of the perceptual dimensions compared to the expert vocabulary. The study of the preference test identifies two opposed liking directions. They are linearly linked to the first perceptual dimensions of both the MDS and sensory maps. These results show that free sorting can be associated with a classical hedonic test with na\"{\i}ve consumers. A rather large number of subjects enables many words to be collected, and these give a clear explanation of the underlying perceptual dimensions. This global approach allows preference to be explained by the consumer perceptual dimensions and these dimensions to be interpreted using the words of consumers.},

abstract = {Studies have indicated that profiling and (dis)similarity scaling yield different perceptual product maps. Conceptually, these two procedures are different. This paper looks at a third and alternative method of producing a two-dimensional, perceptual map utilizing a projective-type method whereby individual assessors themselves are required to place products on the space according to the similarities and differences they perceive. However, visual comparison of the final results provided by each assessor is difficult and, hence, generalized Procrustes analysis is applied to compare each assessor's map for similarity with the others. In this study it was found that the perceptual map derived from projective mapping was as similar to the map derived from profiling as from dissimilarity scaling. However, consistency over repeated trials was greater for projective mapping than for the other two methods. It is suggested that projective mapping could be a potentially useful technique for linking sensory analysis and consumer research data.},

We propose that the most highly palatable foods are likely to have higher levels of "dynamic contrast" (moment-to-moment sensory contrast from the everchanging properties of foods manipulated in the mouth). The sensory feature contributing most to dynamic contrast seems to be somatosensation. Texture, for example, over the course of masticating a crunchy food, changes markedly such that each alteration contributes differently and dynamically to sensory contrast. Our purpose herein is to propose that dynamic contrast contributes significantly to palatability of foods and beverages.},

Individually, both dietary curcumin and capsaicin significantly inhibited the in vivo iron-induced LDL oxidation, as well as copper-induced oxidation of LDL in vitro. The protective effect of the combination of curcumin and capsaicin on LDL oxidation was greater than that of individual compounds. This protective influence of spice principles was also indicated by the relative anodic electrophoretic mobility of oxidized LDL on agarose gel. In another study, rats injected with iron showed hepatic toxicity as measured by an increase in lipid peroxides and elevated serum enzymes, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase. Dietary curcumin, capsaicin and their combination reduced the activities of these enzymes, and lowered the liver lipid peroxide level, indicating amelioration of the severity of iron-induced hepatotoxicity. In yet another study, a comparison of the extent of carrageenan-induced paw inflammation showed that both dietary curcumin and capsaicin moderately lowered inflammation, while the spice principles in combination were more effective. Dietary curcumin and capsaicin significantly decreased the activity of 5'-lipoxygenase activity in the polymorphonuclear lymphocytes in carrageenan-injected rats, the decrease being even higher in the case of combination of these two spice principles. Results suggest that dietary curcumin and capsaicin individually are protective to LDL oxidation both in vivo and in vitro, to iron-induced hepatotoxicity and to carrageenan-induced inflammation. This beneficial effect was higher when the two compounds were fed in combination.},

abstract = {A new psychological law, called the law of comparative judgment, is presented with some of its special applications in the measurement of psychological values. This law is applicable not only to the comparison of physical stimulus intensities but also to qualitative comparative judgments, such as those of excellence of specimens in an educational scale. It should be possible also to verify it on comparative judgments which involve simultaneous and successive contrast. The law is stated as follows:[Equation omitted]in which S-sub(1) and S-sub(2) are the psychological scale values of the two compared stimuli; x-sub(12) is the sigma value corresponding to the proportion of judgments p-sub(1) > p-sub(2). ?-sub(1) is the discriminal dispersion of stimulus R-sub(1) and ?-sub(2) is the dispersion of stimulus R-sub(2). r is the correlation between the discriminal deviations of R-sub(1) and R-sub(2) in the same judgment. This law is basic for work on Weber's and Fechner's laws, applies to the judgments of a single observer who compares a series of stimuli by the method of paired comparisons when no "equal" judgments are allowed, and is a rational equation for the method of constant stimuli. The law is then applied to five cases each of which involves different assumptions and different degrees of simplification of the law for practical use. The weighting of the observation equations is discussed because the observation equations obtained with the five cases are not of the same reliability and hence should not be equally weighted.

abstract = {Although people assume that they see the surrounding environment as it truly is, we suggest that perception of the natural environment is dependent upon the internal goal states of perceivers. Five experiments demonstrated that perceivers tend to see desirable objects (i.e., those that can fulfill immediate goals—a water bottle to assuage their thirst, money they can win, a personality test providing favorable feedback) as physically closer to them than less desirable objects. Biased distance perception was revealed through verbal reports and through actions toward the object (e.g., underthrowing a beanbag at a desirable object). We suggest that seeing desirable objects as closer than less desirable objects serves the self-regulatory function of energizing the perceiver to approach objects that fulfill needs and goals.},

Therefore, this research was undertaken to characterize oral pungency of the principal irritants or red pepper (capsaicin), black pepper (piperine), cinnamon (cinnamaldehyde), cumin (cuminaldehyde), cloves (eugenol), ginger (ginger oleoresin), and alcohol (ethanol). These compounds were evaluated for four pungent qualities (burning, tingling, numbing, overall), two temporal qualities (lag time, overall duration), and three spatial qualities (longitudinal location, lateral location, localized/diffuse). The pungency of cinnamaldehyde was primarily burning and tingling. It had a quick onset and rapid decay. The pungency of eugenol had a long-lasting, predominantly numbing effect. The pungency piperine, capsaicin and ginger were primarily burning, but had different temporal and spatial responses. The pungency of ethanol was most diffuse in nature, with some burning and tingling sensations. It had the shortest perceived onset and overall duration. The pungency of cuminaldehyde was equally burning, tingling and numbing.},

abstract = {Evaluation of the performance of a new diagnostic procedure with respect to a standard procedure arises frequently in practice. The response of interest, often in a dichotomous form, is measured twice, once with each procedure. The two procedures are administered to either two matched individuals, or when practical, to the same individual. A large sample test for matched-pair data is the McNemar test. The main assumption of this test is independent paired responses; however, when more than one outcome from an individual is measured by each procedure, the data are clustered. Examples of such cases can be seen in dental and ophthalmology studies. Variance adjustment methods for the analysis of clustered matched-pair data have been proposed; however, because of unequal cluster sizes, variability of correlation structures within a cluster (within paired responses in a cluster as well as between paired responses in a cluster), and unequal success probabilities among the clusters, the performances of some available methods are not consistent. This research proposes a simple adjustment to the McNemar test for the analysis of clustered matched-pair data. Method of moments is used to calculate a consistent variance estimator. Using Monte Carlo simulation, the size and power of the proposed test are compared to those of two currently available methods. To illustrate practical application, clustered matched-pair data from two clinical studies are analysed.},

abstract = {Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most lethal malignancies and there is no effective preventive measure in this highly malignant disease to date. In the present study, we investigated the chemopreventive potential of capsaicin (8-methyl-N- vanillyl-6-nonenamide), the principal pungent ingredient found in hot red pepper, in SK-Hep-1 hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Treatment of capsaicin inhibited growth of SK-Hep-1 cells in a concentration-dependent manner while 4-methoxy capsaicin (Met-capsaicin) was less potent. This inhibitory effect of capsaicin on SK-Hep-1 cell growth was mainly due to the induction of apoptosis as evidenced by DNA fragmentation and nuclear condensation. Furthermore, capsaicin prominently reduced the ratio of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 to pro-apoptotic Bax and consequently increased caspase-3 activity. These results demonstrate that capsaicin efficiently induced apoptosis in SK-Hep-1 cells through a caspase-3-dependent mechanism, which may contribute to its chemopreventive function.},

A two-dimensional stimulus configuration best represented the data from each of the three methods. The underlying dimensions of stimulus space were identified from free-choice profiling data and also explained some background variables. The texture, sweetness, sourness, grape flavor and color contributed to both dimensions. All three methods were very similar in describing the most important differences among stimuli as suggested by the highly significant correlation between their first dimensions. The Procrustes analysis coupled with permutation tests, as well as RV coefficient, indicated that similarity scaling and free-choice profiling reached maximum consensus, whereas multidimensional sorting shared slightly lesser consensus with the other two methods.},

abstract = {An alternative analysis of forced-choice threshold data sets such as the type generated by ASTM method E-679 involves a simple interpolation of chance-corrected 50\% detection. This analysis has several potential advantages. The analysis does not require the ad hoc heuristics for estimating individual thresholds above and below the series. It takes into account the possibility of guessing correctly, which is not considered in the ASTM calculations and produces a downward bias to the estimates. It does not discount correct responses early in the series which may be legitimate detections, but which are discounted by the ASTM method if followed by any incorrect response. Comparisons of the two methods in a large consumer study of odor detection threshold study data set gave comparable values. The interpolation can also be done to determine other levels of detection (e.g. 10, 25\%). These values other than 50\% can be potentially useful in setting regulatory standards for water or air pollution limits or to food manufacturers who wish to avoid detection of taints by more sensitive individuals. The forced choice methods for threshold estimation have proven practically useful in comparing the potency of various flavor materials and in comparing the sensitivities of individuals. The ASTM method E-679 is one such method. The alternative analysis of results from this procedure which is outlined here provides additional information and does not exhibit the downward bias because of correct guessing.},

Meeting these criteria enables the use of descriptive data in several applications: (1) interpretation of other sensory data, (2) correlation with instrumental measures, (3) quality monitoring, and (4) product development and maintenance. Several aspects of the specific terminology and the way it is taught are important in effective descriptive analysis. Terms should be uncorrelated with one another. Terms should be related to physical or chemical references. Training a panel requires the establishment of a system in which relevant dimensions can be abstracted and attended to. In this paper, specific problems of descriptive analysis training such as the choice of reference sets and the boundaries of terms are discussed.},

abstract = {Differences between 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP) taster groups have long been the focus of studies on individual variation in perception of oral sensation. Recently, "thermal taste" was described, the phenomenon whereby some individuals perceive "phantom" taste sensations after thermal stimulation of small areas of the tongue. As with PROP taster status (PTS), thermal taster status (TTS) has been proposed as a proxy for general responsiveness to oral stimuli. Here we examined the influence of PTS and TTS, independently, on the perceived intensity of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, astringent, and metallic stimuli, and temperature on heating or cooling the tongue. Interactions between PTS and TTS were also examined, and fungiform papillae (FP) density and salivary flow rate (SFR) were determined. Both PTS and TTS were associated with perceived stimulus intensities. PROP super-tasters (pSTs) rated all oral stimuli as more intense than PROP non-tasters (pNTs). Thermal tasters (TTs) gave higher logged ratings than thermal non-tasters (TnTs) for all oral sensations including temperature, with the exception of metallic flavour (at low concentration) and PROP. Examination of ETA-squared values showed that PTS had a greater effect on perceived intensities than did TTS for most sensations. No PTS*TTS interaction was found for any oral stimuli. In contrast with PTS, TTS was not associated with FP density, and neither PTS nor TTS were associated with SFR. We conclude that pSTs and TTs possess greater responsiveness across a range of taste and trigeminal stimuli and concentrations.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the method of projective mapping and its use in sensory analysis. Projective mapping is a method which allows naive consumers to map products on a two dimension space, based on similarities and differences in the products. An experiment was carried out on seven blueberry soups, whereby sensory profiling was undertaken using a trained panel and projective mapping. Preference assessment was undertaken using a small group of consumers. Results indicated that the three replicates of the mapping exercise produced visually very similar maps, at least on the first two dimensions. However, it was found that consumers perceived the samples in somewhat different ways as high-lighted by RV coefficients. The consensus mapping dimensions were compared to those from the profile data, and it was apparent that the best similarity was found when comparing the first dimension, thus suggesting good agreement on the obvious aspects of the product. The internal preference map also revealed major product contrasts along this dimension with some weak evidence of segmentation. The overall conclusion of this paper raises further fundamental questions about consensus spaces with consumers, and the question of dimensionality of consumer perception as compared to trained panels.},

Similarity was defined both in terms of direct subjective judgments of over-all resemblance and in terms of the frequencies with which the stimuli were actually confused during identification learning. The results were incompatible with the static, Euclidean metric assumed by multidimensional scaling models. Apparently, when the stimuli vary along perceptually distinct dimensions, the psychological metric changes as subjects shift their attention more to one dimension or the other. The interstimulus similarities for any one state of attention, however, appear to conform with a Minkowski metric somewhere between the Euclidean and "city-block" varieties.},

abstract = {Freshness is a holistic attribute of a food product, with meaning that most often includes how recently produced or harvested a food currently is, to what extent it has been preserved, and it is the opposite of stale or spoiled. The sensory properties of foods contribute very significantly to consumer freshness perceptions, but these properties are not easily identified and described as they will vary considerably between different product types. The aim of this investigation was to improve the understanding of the sensory properties that contribute to the perceived freshness of different baked product types, including breads, biscuits and cakes. Two separate consumer studies were conducted. In the first study, consumers evaluated product freshness based on appearance, flavour and texture and in the second, consumers only evaluated product odour. Qualitative information detailing the product characteristics that consumers most associated with freshness was collected following assessment at each study. In order to better understand the sensory properties associated with product freshness, a trained sensory panel carried out descriptive analysis with the baked products, using a defined vocabulary. Individual differences in perceived product freshness were represented on two-dimensional Freshness Maps generated using Principal Component Analysis. Results showed the relative similarities and differences between the product types on the basis of individual freshness perceptions. Consumers used similar terms to describe product freshness, but different terms were associated with specific product types. Relationships between consumer freshness ratings and descriptive analysis showed attributes that were positively and negatively associated with freshness for each product type when evaluated following either consumption, or by odour only. It was found that sensory characteristics perceived to be fresh in one product type was not necessarily fresh in another. Comparisons between consumer and sensory vocabularies showed specific appearance, odour, taste and textural cues that consumers associated with product freshness were used to differentiate the same products cognitively.},

abstract = {Sensory characterisation of virgin olive oil is completely standardised in the European Union. The sensory profile used to evaluate samples is made up of 16 descriptors, three of them being generic. These three attributes [Other ripe fruit(s), Other positive attribute(s) and Other negative attribute(s)] could be of great additional interest in the characterisation of different samples. However, as they are not specifically defined it is difficult to reach a descriptor consensus among assessors evaluating the samples. This situation is similar to that produced when using a Free Choice Profile and so the Generalised Procrustes Analysis (GPA) could be extremely useful in obtaining all the information contained in these three generic descriptors. In this study GPA was applied to the descriptors generated by a 25 member expert panel under the headings Other ripe fruits and Other positive attributes when evaluating 11 samples of virgin olive oil from the variety [`]Arbequina' grown in three different regions. The Generalised Procrustes Analysis was efficient in the sensory characterisation of the 11 samples studied using the information provided by the two positive generic descriptors included in the official sensory profile. The overall result was equivalent to that obtained using Correspondence Analysis, although the GPA gave more information since it also included the intensity of each of the descriptors and was less affected by odd descriptors. This technique was as useful in the characterisation of the samples as the other six positive descriptors defined in the official sensory profile (Olive fruity, Apple, Green, Sweet, Bitter, and Pungent), providing additional information of great scientific and commercial interest.},

Considering consumption of capsaicin as a food additive and its current medicinal application in humans, correct evaluation and precise assessment of any harmful effects of this compound are essential from the public health standpoint. Numerous investigations have been conducted to determine the potential mutagenic and carcinogenic activity of capsaicin and chili pepper, but results are discordant.

MDS of the sorting data and Procrustes analyses of PM data collected on unlabeled axis grouped the bars according to function and provided a meaningful spatial relationship in one dimension. However, MDS analysis of these PM data grouped the bars by similarity-of-use and provided a meaningful spatial interpretation in two dimensions. The CA analysis was not effective in separating the bars by similarity-of-use but did provide an indication of liking. A comparison of spatial configurations using RV coefficients showed moderate correlations between the methods. A panelist survey showed no significant differences in the ease-of-use, task interest or level-of-satisfaction with the final arrangement between the sorting and the PM data collection methods, but panelists did find it easier to change their minds using the PM procedure.},

Our objectives were to determine opinions, preferences, and uses of Viola tricolor L. `Helen Mount' (viola), Borago officinalis L. (borage), and Tropaeolum majus L. `Jewel Mix' (nasturtium). Flowers were grown using certifiable organic methods and chosen to reflect a variety of flower tastes, textures, and appearances. We quantified three attributes (taste, fragrance, and visual appeal) with a total of seven semantic, differential scales adapted from a scaling authority. The attributes were rated as: visual--"appealing", "desirable," and "very interested in tasting"; fragrance--"appealing" and "pleasant"; and taste--"tasty" and "desirable". Garden Day participants were self-selected to evaluate and taste flowers from a consumer perspective. When asked to rate the three species on visual appeal and desire, no less than 76\% of consumers awarded all flowers an acceptable rating. We found similar results when consumers answered questions regarding the taste of two of the three species. Results from this study support our hypothesis that customers would rate edible flower attributes highly and would be likely to purchase and serve the three species tested. Members of the Michigan Chefs de Cuisine Association participated in a similar survey. At least 66\% of these chefs rated the three visual attributes and two fragrance attributes of viola and nasturtium acceptable. Chefs' ratings of the fragrance of borage as "appealing" and "pleasant" were higher than those of consumers, but the ratings were still low, 21\% and 25\%, respectively. Unlike consumers, chefs' ratings of the taste of viola as "appealing" and "desirable" were low (29\% and 36\%, respectively). We found some minor differences in ratings when groups were compared, using demographic variables as a basis for segmentation, indicating a homogenous marketing strategy may be employed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Decreased appetite and increased energy expenditure after oral consumption of red pepper has been shown.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to assess the relative oral and gastrointestinal contribution to capsaicin-induced satiety and its effects on food intake or macronutrient selection.

METHODS:For 24 subjects (12 men and 12 women; age: 35plusminus10 y; BMI: 25.0plusminus2.4 kg/m2; range 20–30), 16 h food intake was assessed four times during 2 consecutive days by offering macronutrient-specific buffets and boxes with snacks, in our laboratory restaurant. At 30 min before each meal, 0.9 g red pepper (0.25\% capsaicin; 80 000 Scoville Thermal Units) or a placebo was offered in either tomato juice or in two capsules that were swallowed with tomato juice. Hunger and satiety were recorded using Visual Analogue Scales.

RESULTS:Average daily energy intake in the placebo condition was 11.5plusminus1.0 MJ/d for the men and 9.4plusminus0.8 MJ/d for the women. After capsaicin capsules, energy intake was 10.4plusminus0.6 and 8.3plusminus0.5 MJ/d (P<0.01); after capsaicin in tomato juice, it was 9.9plusminus0.7 and 7.9plusminus0.5 MJ/d, respectively (compared to placebo: P<0.001; compared to capsaicin in capsules: P<0.05). En \% from carbohydrate/protein/fat (C/P/F): changed from 46plusminus3/15plusminus1/39plusminus2 to 52plusminus4/15plusminus1/33plusminus2 en\% (P<0.01) in the men, and from 48plusminus4/14plusminus2/38plusminus3 to 42plusminus4/14plusminus2/32plusminus3 en\% (P<0.01) in the women, in both capsaicin conditions. Satiety (area under the curve) increased from 689 to 757 mmh in the men and from 712 to 806 mmh in the women, both (P<0.01). Only in the oral exposure condition was the reduction in energy intake and the increase in satiety related to perceived spiciness.

CONCLUSION:In the short term, both oral and gastrointestinal exposure to capsaicin increased satiety and reduced energy and fat intake; the stronger reduction with oral exposure suggests a sensory effect of capsaicin.},

abstract = {Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;In this paper, we review the empirical literature concerning the important question of whether or not food color influences
  taste and flavor perception in humans. Although a superficial reading of the literature on this topic would appear to give
  a somewhat mixed answer, we argue that this is, at least in part, due to the fact that many researchers have failed to distinguish
  between two qualitatively distinct research questions. The first concerns the role that food coloring plays in the perception
  of the intensity of a particular flavor (e.g., strawberry, banana, etc.) or taste attribute (e.g., sweetness, saltiness, etc.). The second
  concerns the role that food coloring plays in the perception of flavor identity. The empirical evidence regarding the first question is currently rather ambiguous. While some researchers have reported
  a significant crossmodal effect of changing the intensity of a food or drink’s coloring on people’s judgments of taste or
  flavor intensity, many others have failed to demonstrate any such effect. By contrast, the research findings concerning the
  second question clearly support the view that people’s judgments of flavor identity are often affected by the changing of
  a food or drink’s color (be it appropriate, inappropriate, or absent). We discuss the possible mechanisms underlying these
  crossmodal effects and suggest some of the key directions for future research in order to move our understanding in this area

As the application of these methods obviously does not occur in a vacuum, we sketch the contextual basis of these methods. A unifying model, illustrating the tasks required from a sensory panellist, is presented with the aim of illuminating some major differences between methods. The history and main developments in the field of descriptive sensory profiling are outlined in a basic pedigree of methods. The authors suggest an approach to sensory profiling where taylor-made, problem oriented, methods are devised and used.},

abstract = {Five tastes have been identified, each of which is transduced by a separate set of taste cells. Of these sour, which is associated with acid stimuli, is the least understood. Genetic ablation experiments have established that sour is detected by a subset of taste cells that express the TRP channel PKD2L1 and its partner PKD1L3, however the mechanisms by which this subset of cells detects acids remain unclear. Previous efforts to understand sour taste transduction have been hindered because sour responsive cells represent only a small fraction of cells in a taste bud, and numerous ion channels with no role in sour sensing are sensitive to acidic pH. To identify acid-sensitive conductances unique to sour cells, we created genetically modified mice in which sour cells were marked by expression of YFP under the control of the PKD2L1 promoter. To measure responses to sour stimuli we developed a method in which suction electrode recording is combined with UV photolysis of NPE-caged proton. Using these methods, we report that responses to sour stimuli are not mediated by Na+ permeable channels as previously thought, but instead are mediated by a proton conductance specific to PKD2L1-expressing taste cells. This conductance is sufficient to drive action potential firing in response to acid stimuli, is enriched in the apical membrane of PKD2L1-expressing taste cells and is not affected by targeted deletion of the PKD1L3 gene. We conclude that, during sour transduction, protons enter through an apical proton conductance to directly depolarize the taste cell membrane.},

Beyond classical application fields, such as approximation, combinatorial optimization, graphics, and operations research, graph algorithms have recently attracted increased attention from computational molecular biology and computational chemistry. Centered around the fundamental issue of graph isomorphism, this text goes beyond classical graph problems of shortest paths, spanning trees, flows in networks, and matchings in bipartite graphs. Advanced algorithmic results and techniques of practical relevance are presented in a coherent and consolidated way. This book introduces graph algorithms on an intuitive basis followed by a detailed exposition in a literate programming style, with correctness proofs as well as worst-case analyses. Furthermore, full C++ implementations of all algorithms presented are given using the LEDA library of efficient data structures and algorithms.},

abstract = {Many product optimization methods, known in general terms as preference mapping, have been described in the literature. However, a direct comparison of some of the different approaches (e.g., internal versus external mapping) has not been undertaken. This was attempted here by formulating strawberry yogurt prototypes according to an experimental design including three factors, investigating four approaches of optimization, comparing the sensory profiles of the ideal solutions and formulating the ideal solutions for validation with consumers. Results of this study show that the optimization methods did not yield identical ideal solutions but tended to agree on the ideal level for two of the three sensory dimensions investigated. These results warrant further investigation and comparison of the preference mapping methods available today. The research conducted in this study may be useful to consumer scientists and product developers as it provides a direct comparison of preference mapping methodology performance for the optimization of product formulations. Although the work is not intended to establish superiority of one method over another, it provides a template for others who may wish to compare these methodologies.},

Scales' performance was judged using the following criteria: number of significant dimensions (p = 5\%) in the MDPREF, number of significantly fitted consumers (p = 5\%) and segmentation of the products and consumers. The MDPREF generated by the hybrid scale data produced the greatest number of significant dimensions (p = 5\%), yielding 79.5\% of significantly fitted consumers (p = 5\%), while the MDPREFs of the self-adjusting and the nine-point scales fitted 54.5\% and 51.8\% of the consumers, respectively. Overall, the results indicated superiority of the hybrid scale over the traditional hedonic and self-adjusting scales.},

Subjects were allowed to create up to 10 different meals under one of four instructions. The cards were dispensed from a specially designed box that could hold single or multiple copies of each food item. Younger students created significantly more meals with few components than did the older students. The types of foodstuffs selected and their groupings were highly similar across grades and for both boys and girls. The meals tended to correspond to those actually available in the school lunch program, but more than 50\% of the creations were unique in that each of them was produced by one or two students. These findings suggest that school nutritionists and administrators should strive for maximum variety in their lunch menus.},

These findings may have important implications for the interpretation of results from many methods which involve a comparison of distance estimates in a multidimensional space.},

Seven screened panelists were chosen to evaluate three commercial tomato pasta sauces after each training period. Panelist performance improved with increased training. Sample differences were observed in all texture attributes and some flavor attributes, even after the shortest training time (4 h). However, more differences were found with at least 60 h of product training. After 120 h of training, product differences for all texture attributes and most of the flavor attributes studied could be ascertained by the trained panelists. These results suggested that only limited training may be necessary to find differences among products for many texture attributes and some flavor attributes. However, extensive training may be required to reduce variation among panelists and increase the discriminant abilities of panelists.},

abstract = {Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;The process by which man accepts or rejects food is of a multi-dimensional nature. In complex food matrices, it is not always easy to establish relationships between the individual chemical stimuli concentration, physiological perception, and consumer reaction. Consumers’ responses to food are not only based on the sensory characteristics of the product and on their physiological status but they are also related to other factors, such as previous information acquired about the product, their past experience, and their attitudes and beliefs. This paper discusses different methods to obtain information about consumer perceptions, attitudes, beliefs, and expectations.},

abstract = {Definition of texture is reviewed, and a system for classification of textural characteristics of foods is described. The system is based on fundamental rheological principles, and at the same time is suitable for routine use. Textural characteristics are defined and classified into mechanical and geometrical qualities as well as those related to the moisture and fat content of a product. The mechanical characteristics are subdivided into the primary parameters of hardness, cohesiveness, viscosity, elasticity, and adhesiveness, and into the secondary parameters of brittleness, chewiness, and gumminess. It is pointed out that popular terms used to describe texture often denote degrees of intensity of these characteristics. The proposed classification lends itself to use with both objective and subjective methods of texture characterization.},

abstract = {Two non-quantitative, non-descriptive procedures, similarity sorting and preference ranking, were used to compare the tastes of 13 different water types. Each procedure was conducted with a different set of completely untrained assessors. A total of 25 assessors took part in the sorting procedure and 87 in the ranking procedure. After multidimensional scaling there was good agreement between the spatial configurations of sample types given by the two procedures. In both configurations there was distinct clustering of the different water types. Bottled and untreated waters were preferred to distilled and tap waters by the majority of the assessors. Carbon filtration did not appear to make a large improvement to the acceptability of tap and distilled waters, but did alter the character of tap water as perceived by the assessors. It is concluded that the procedures and analyses are efficient and economical methods of obtaining detailed information about sensory differences among water types and the perception of water quality and are suitable for use with untrained assessors and large numbers of sample types.},

abstract = {There is increasing evidence supporting an oral chemosensory detection system for free fatty acids (FFA). The presumptive transduction mechanisms have different ligand specificities. Psychophysical studies with FFA varying in chain length and saturation may aid in identifying the presence and functionality of these mechanisms in humans. Oral detection thresholds were measured for linoleic, stearic, lauric, and caproic acids in 32 healthy adults by an ascending, 3-alternative, forced-choice, sip and spit procedure. Thresholds were obtained for all fatty acids from all participants, but the distributions were wide and nonnormal. Thresholds were not correlated between fatty acids nor with thresholds for sucrose (taste), butanol (olfactory), mineral oil, or gum acacia (both somatosensory). These data demonstrate human oral sensitivity to short-, medium-, and long-chain FFA and suggest the presence of multiple transduction mechanisms. The findings are consistent with, but do not definitively demonstrate, a role for taste that may have a genetic basis.},

Regardless of training or expertise, models of different subject groups were highly similar as measured by interpoint distance correlations (median r = 0.74). The retest correlation of one group tested twice with no intervening training was 0.85. A two-dimensional model provided a better fit to the data of fragrance descriptive panelists than to that of other subjects, but the configuration of these trained panelists was qualitatively similar to all other groups. The method of odor sorting as analyzed by multidimensional scaling was relatively unaffected by learning or other cognitive/linguistic influences on odor perception and showed a fair degree of reliability and inter-group consistency in odor quality perception.},

The subjects also rated the pleasantness of individual components. The unsalted bread without spread but with low-salt, low-fat cheese and any of the milk types received the lowest hedonic ratings, whereas the regular-salt bread with spread and with any of the cheese and milk options received the highest. The pleasantness of individual components predicted the pleasantness of a combination by only 10-40\% (multiple regression analysis). Thus the pleasantness of an entity depended on the pleasantness of components only to a very limited extent. The absence of major elements, such as spread on bread or the salty taste in bread, had major effects on acceptance.},

Besides others, these are the different use of the descriptors by the assessors and the different use of the scales. The two most important approaches to cope with such data are given by Generalized Procrustes Analysis (GPA) and STATIS. Recently, for the latter one several variants have been proposed in order to either simplify the calculation or to improve the results. The aim of this paper is to compare these methods with respect to their performance. For this purpose, a model will be stated to describe the outcomes of a sensory profiling study. On the basis of this model, we give a short insight into the ideas of the methods under consideration, and simulations to compare these methods are realised. From those, systematical differences between the methods occur. Finally, a comparison between the methods with respect to the interpretation of the estimated consensuses is given by means of graphically displaying the outcomes. For the considered data, it will be found that the choice of the method is arbitrary.},

abstract = {A unified quantitative approach to modeling Ss' identification and categorization of multidimensional perceptual stimuli is proposed and tested. Two Ss identified and categorized the same set of perceptually confusable stimuli varying on separable dimensions. The identification data were modeled using R. N. Shepard's (see record 1959-05134-001) multidimensional scaling-choice framework, which was then extended to model the Ss' categorization performance. The categorization model, which generalizes the context theory of classification developed by D. L. Medin and M. M. Schaffer (see record 1979-12633-001), assumes that Ss store category exemplars in memory. Classification decisions are based on the similarity of stimuli to the stored exemplars. It is assumed that the same multidimensional perceptual representation underlies performance in both the identification and categorization paradigms. However, because of the influence of selective attention, similarity relationships change systematically across the 2 paradigms. Findings provide some support for the hypothesis that Ss distribute attention among component dimensions so as to optimize categorization performance and that Ss may have augmented their category representations with inferred exemplars. Results demonstrate that excellent predictions of categorization performance can be made given knowledge of performance in an identification paradigm. (51 ref) },

abstract = {Background: A combination of tyrosine, capsaicin, catechines and caffeine may stimulate the sympathetic nervous system and promote satiety, lipolysis and thermogenesis. In addition, dietary calcium may increase fecal fat excretion.

Objective: To investigate the acute and subchronic effect of a supplement containing the above mentioned agents or placebo taken t.i.d on thermogenesis, body fat loss and fecal fat excretion.

Design: In total, 80 overweight–obese subjects ((body mass index) 31.2plusminus2.5 kg/m2, meanplusminuss.d.) underwent an initial 4-week hypocaloric diet (3.4 MJ/day). Those who lost>4\% body weight were instructed to consume a hypocaloric diet (-1.3 MJ/day) and were randomized to receive either placebo (n=23) or bioactive supplement (n=57) in a double-blind, 8-week intervention. The thermogenic effect of the compound was tested at the first and last day of intervention, and blood pressure, heart rate, body weight and composition were assessed.

Results: Weight loss during the induction phase was 6.8plusminus1.9 kg. At the first exposure the thermogenic effect of the bioactive supplement exceeded that of placebo by 87.3 kJ/4 h (95\%CI: 50.9;123.7, P=0.005) and after 8 weeks this effect was sustained (85.5 kJ/4 h (47.6;123.4), P=0.03). Body fat mass decreased more in the supplement group by 0.9 kg (0.5; 1.3) compared with placebo (P<0.05). The bioactive supplement had no effect on fecal fat excretion, blood pressure or heart rate.

Conclusion: The bioactive supplement increased 4-h thermogenesis by 90 kJ more than placebo, and the effect was maintained after 8 weeks and accompanied by a slight reduction in fat mass. These bioactive components may support weight maintenance after a hypocaloric diet.},

abstract = {An individual differences model for multidimensional scaling is outlined in which individuals are assumed differentially to weight the several dimensions of a common “psychological space”. A corresponding method of analyzing similarities data is proposed, involving a generalization of “Eckart-Young analysis” to decomposition of three-way (or higher-way) tables. In the present case this decomposition is applied to a derived three-way table of scalar products between stimuli for individuals. This analysis yields a stimulus by dimensions coordinate matrix and a subjects by dimensions matrix of weights. This method is illustrated with data on auditory stimuli and on perception of nations.},

abstract = {This study examined the contributions of stimulus fat content and flavor volatiles to the perception of fat in a milk model system. The model system was formulated by adding bland vegetable oil (0\%, 5\%, or 10\% w/v) and natural cream flavor (0\%, 0.5\% or 1\% w/v) to a skim milk base. Panelists judged pairs of samples for similarity on the basis of three attributes (fat content, mouthcoating and thickness) and the results were analyzed using a multidimensional scaling procedure. Two-dimensional solutions best represented the data. The stimulus spaces for fat content and mouthcoating were visually similar to each other and provided reasonable separation of the samples. Instrumental measures helped to define the underlying dimensions of the stimulus space for fat content. Dimension 1 related to texture and included the contributions of viscosity, and fat particle size and number distribution; dimension 2 related to flavor perception. The sample with a moderate fat content (5\%) and the highest concentration of added cream flavor (1\%) was perceived to be similar to the 10\% fat samples with added flavor. Thus, the added flavor provided the sensation of higher fat content. These data suggest that flavor plays an important role in the preception of fat in dairy foods. A psychophysical model of fat perception in dairy foods is proposed which includes the contribution of viscosity, fat particle size and number distribution, and volatile flavor perceptions.},

The original and modified questionnaires yielded comparable results for different shampoos. Results of characterizing various product categories with the new questionnaire indicated that it is relevant to differentiate the feelings evoked by odors from fragranced and flavored products, which can be perceptually distinct or similar. In addition, the verbal measurement of feelings provides insight into consumer liking, improving the discrimination of products that have similar liking scores.},

In general, the similarity-based approach is seen to require a minimum of conceptual organization and relations, whereas the theory-based approach emphasizes both. It is concluded that each theory provides an inadequate account of conceptual coherence (or no account at all), because none provides enough constraints on possible concepts. The authors propose that concepts are coherent to the extent that they fit people's background knowledge or naive theories about the world. These theories help to relate the concepts in a domain and to structure the attributes that are internal to a concept. Evidence of the influence of theories on various conceptual tasks is presented, and the possible importance of theories in cognitive development is discussed.

abstract = {In this paper we present a new method called distatis that can be applied to the analysis of sorting data. Distatis is a generalization of classical multidimensional scaling which allows one to analyze 3-ways distance tables. When used for analyzing sorting tasks, distatis takes into account individual sorting data. Specifically, when distatis is used to analyze the results of an experiment in which several assessors sort a set of products, we obtain two types of maps: One for the assessors and one for the products. In these maps, the proximity between two points reflects their similarity, and therefore these maps can be read using the same rules as standard metric multidimensional scaling methods or principal component analysis. Technically, distatis starts by transforming the individual sorting data into cross-product matrices as in classical mds and evaluating the similarity between these matrices (using Escoufier’s RV coefficient). Then it computes a compromise matrix which is the best aggregate (in the least square sense, as statis does) of the individual cross-product matrices and analyzes it with pca. The individual matrices are then projected onto the compromise space. In this paper, we present a short tutorial, and we illustrate how to use distatis with a sorting task in which ten assessors evaluated eight beers. We also provide some insights into how distatis evaluates the similarity between assessors.},

Furthermore, due to rapid advance in technology and Web proliferation, creating a Web search engine today is very different from three years ago. This paper provides an in-depth description of our large-scale Web search engine — the first such detailed public description we know of to date. Apart from the problems of scaling traditional search techniques to data of this magnitude, there are new technical challenges involved with using the additional information present in hypertext to produce better search results. This paper addresses this question of how to build a practical large-scale system which can exploit the additional information present in hypertext.

abstract = {Three experiments were conducted to compare the relative performance of hedonic scaling methods, including the labeled affective magnitude (LAM) scale. In the first study, three versions of the LAM were used to evaluate 20 phrases that described diverse sensory experiences. One scale was anchored to "greatest imaginable like/dislike for any experience" and another used the "greatest imaginable like" phrase of the LAM but with the interior phrases repositioned relative to "any experience." The scale anchored to "any experience" showed a smaller range of scale usage and lower statistical differentiation, relative to the LAM scale, with the repositioned scale intermediate. Two further experiments compared the LAM to the nine-point hedonic scale, an 11-point category scale using the LAM phrases, and to a three-label line scale, a simplified version of the LAM with only the end phrases and the neutral center-point phrase. All scales showed similar differentiation of juices in the second study and sensory experience phrases in the third. A modest advantage for the LAM scale in the second experiment did not extend to the third study. Researchers should be careful in the choice of high end anchors for hedonic scales, as a compressed range of scale usage may result in lower product differentiation. Hedonic scales for food acceptability are widely used in new product development for consumer testing and in food preference surveys. A desired goal of efficient sensory evaluation testing is the ability of tests to differentiate samples on the basis of scale data, in this case scales commonly used for food acceptability and preference testing. Scales which are able to differentiate products more effectively are less likely to lead to Type II error in experimentation, in which true differences between products are not detected. Such errors can lead to lost opportunities for product improvements or to enhanced chances for taking undetected risks in the case of false parity conclusions.},

@article{Moskowitz1983,
abstract = {A quantitative method to evaluate the overall preference of cyclic menus is presented. The model developed consists of two separate factors relating to menu preference rating. The first factor is the time-preference relationship for food items. From survey data, time-preference functions have been constructed which indicate how the hedonic rating of a food item varies with the time since the food was last served. The function assumes a quadratic form with entrees tending to be most time sensitive and salads and vegetables the least. The second factor is the meal component weights for the evaluaton of an entire meal based on the consumer hedonic preference values for the generic components of the meal (entree, starch, vegetable, salad, and dessert). Regression techniques have been applied to survey data to generate the set of importance factors, or meal component weights, for each component. For example, the results indicate that the entree represents about 49\% of the total preference value of the meal. This approach has provided a basis for an additive linear model for overall meal preference. A general system for the overall evaluation of cyclic menus has also been developed based on application of an additive linear model. This procedure accounts for the maximum preference values for food items, the time-dependency of the food item preference values, and the meal component weighting factors and is easily adapted to the computer, as shown by a specific example. The overall system appears to offer a logical, realistic, and integrated approach which reflects time factors and the relative importances of the various components of meals in the evaluation of cyclic menus. Further research in this area is recommended to refine this model and test its validity in an operational environment.},

abstract = {Dissimilarity measures (D) derived from sortings of stimuli can be submitted to multidimensional scaling (MDS) either directly, or after transforming them to profile distances (\^{I}”) computed on the rows of the D matrix. The latter procedure was criticized by Drasgow and Jones (1979) who performed two simulation studies, which are criticized here in turn. In the present article two sets of real sorting data were used for comparing the results of MDS on D and \^{I}”, both with each other and with the results of two other procedures: multiple correspondence analysis (by means of HOMALS) on the raw sorting data, and MDS on the pairwise similarity ratings of the same stimuli by the same subjects. The three procedures were compared both with respect to the final configurations and with regard to the fit of the corresponding distances to the data. These comparisons suggested that MDS on D is slightly superior to MDS on \^{I}”. The latter analysis, however, yields results that are similar to those of the much more efficient HOMALS program. The differences, however, are on the average very small. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

abstract = {The oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is believed to be the initiating factor for the development and progression of atherosclerosis. The active ingredients of spices such as chili and turmeric (capsaicin and curcumin, respectively) have been shown to reduce the susceptibility of LDL to oxidation. One of the techniques used to study the oxidation of LDL is to isolate LDL and subject it to metal-induced (copper or iron) oxidation. However, whole serum may represent a closer situation to in vivo conditions than using isolated LDL. We investigated the effects of different concentrations (0.1−3 $\mu$M) of capsaicin, dihydrocapsaicin, and curcumin on copper-induced oxidation of serum lipoproteins. The lag time (before initiation of oxidation) and rate of oxidation (slope of propagation phase) were calculated. The lag time increased, and the rate of oxidation decreased with increasing concentrations of the tested antioxidants (p < 0.05). A 50\% increase in lag time (from control) was observed at concentrations between 0.5 and 0.7 $\mu$M for capsaicin, dihydrocapsaicin, and curcumin. This study shows that oxidation of serum lipids is reduced by capsaicinoids and curcumin in a concentration-dependent manner.},

The goal of this work is to generate a diet that meets the nutrient requirements of astronauts and satiates them. The constraints involved in shorter- and longer-term missions are described. The insight provided by observations of astronauts from the Skylab and Shuttle eras will allow researchers to consider the fact that, for any nutritional regimen to work, it must consider the limitations and taste buds of the individuals involved. Otherwise, the best diet design generated by their work may never be consumed.},

The ratings of experts (1-9 scale) and consumers (02013100 scale) agree quite highly, as shown by the high correlation between the two panels across the 37 products. The paper refutes the notion that consumers are incapable of validly rating the sensory aspects of products. The paper therefore presents the case for using consumers to assess the sensory characteristics of products.},

abstract = {We present aspects and data for a tool-driven database for marketing and product development, which are publicly accessible. The objective is to create a method whereby knowledge of concepts and products can be archived using overviews of a specific product category. The first phase of the database comprises systematic analysis of product concepts, which contain elements dealing both with features and emotions. The concept phase provides an idea about responses to statements about product features, along with responses to emotional elements and brands. The second phase comprises an analysis of the competitive frame of products, even before systematic product development is initiated. This second phase identifies expected and thus reasonable ranges of product-sensory features, levels of acceptance of typical products, relations between liking and sensory attributes and segmentation of sensory preferences. Together, the two phases provide a guide to product developers new in a category, archive current knowledge and provide a sourcebook for marketers and developers alike, which is accessible using research tools. The two phases allow product development to become more scientific, more based on common experience rather than individual expertise and thus more efficient, without compromising corporate knowledge of specific ingredients, processes or business opportunities.},

abstract = {Sensory endings of chorda tympani and lingual (trigeminal) nerve fibers were identified by selective denervation and localized within specific regions of fungiform pipillae in the hamster. The chorda tympani was resected from the middle ear and the peripheral fibers were allowed to degenerate for 1, 3, or 8 days prior to perfusion-fixation and electron-microscopic examination of the anterior tongue. Taste buds were virtually devoid of intact nerves by 3 days following chorda tympani denervation. Remnants of the fibers were restricted to taste buds. Lingual fibers, on the other hand, persist in normal numbers after chorda tympani resection and populate perigemmal areas of connective tissue and extragemmal areas located apically in the squamous, nontaste epithelium surrounding the taste bud. This study provides evidence of a segregation of chorda tympani fibers in the taste bud and lingual nerve fibers in the apical fungiform papilla. The lingual nerve-epithelial arrangement and superficial location, near the least cornified area of the tongue, may be well suited for relatively sensitive somatosensation, possibly mechanoreception. Thus, the apical fungiform papilla appears to be a site where both taste and tactile oral stimuli interact with receptors.},

This paper reviews concepts and procedures on developing a qualitative frame of reference (i.e., the development of a common lexicon, language), and discusses the different alternatives for quantitative frames of reference. Different quantitative frames of reference can be established depending on the philosophy chosen to rate attribute intensities. The three philosophies presented in this manuscript are the universal, product specific and attribute specific scaling approaches. The advantages, disadvantages and uses of each of these techniques are discussed. A well trained panel has sound common qualitative and quantitative frames of reference used in product evaluations. A low panel variability is obtained when both frames of reference are successfully implemented and used.},

The objective of this research was to provide recommendations based on scientific research for the most desirable "wine \& cheese pairs" using nine award-winning Canadian cheeses and 18 BC wines (six white, six red and six specialty wines). Twenty-seven wine and food professionals rated the wine and cheese pairs using a bipolar structured line scale (12 cm). The "ideal pair," scored at the midpoint of the scale, was defined as a wine and cheese combination where neither the wine nor the cheese dominated. For each cheese, mean deviation-from-ideal scores were determined and evaluated by analysis of variance. Scores closest to six were considered "ideal," while higher or lower scores represented pairs where the "wine" or the "cheese" dominated, respectively. In general, white wines had mean scores closer to six ("ideal") than either the red or specialty wines. The late harvest, ice and port-type wines were more difficult to pair . Judges varied considerably in their individual assessments reflecting a high degree of personal expectation and preference.},

The paper then deals in depth with Internet-based interviews, the evolution of conjoint analysis from text + pictures to purely visual approaches, and the introduction of response time as another dependent variable along side direct ratings. The paper finishes with two new areas. One area is the assessment of pair-wise interactions and their magnitude, a topic that is easy to do in response surface analysis but difficult to do in studies where the variables are ‘absent/present’. The second area comprises the integrated databases using linked conjoint analyses, with extensive classification questionnaires. This approach, stimulated by the genomics revolution, aims to create a multi-faceted snapshot of a large-scale category, such as beverages, across products and over time.},

This receptor is a non-selective cation channel that is structurally related to members of the TRP family of ion channels. The cloned capsaicin receptor is also activated by increases in temperature in the noxious range, suggesting that it functions as a transducer of painful thermal stimuli in vivo.},

Companies are increasingly engaging in mass customization and offering consumers a "choiceboard" (or a menu of choices) of various features and options for configuring their own products and services. The authors discuss the use of experimental choice menus for assessing customers' preferences and price sensitivities for the variety of features and options that might be offered by a firm in its choiceboard. The proposed approach directly analyzes customers' portfolio of choices from each of several experimental menus by estimating the utility for each menu item as a function of its characteristics, its price, and other specific attributes such as multifeature discounts. The authors accommodate customer heterogeneity in the utilities, allow for correlation of the utilities across items, and incorporate constraints in menu choices. Various technical issues and methodological contributions are discussed. The authors illustrate the approach in a commercial application of a customized Web-based information service, which is typical of offerings in the information economy. To assess predictive performance, the authors compare the proposed approach with alternative traditional approaches. The authors conclude with a discussion of the types of insights that can be obtained from this approach to menu choices and the managerial implications of these findings.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to develop a semantically labeled hedonic scale (LHS) that would yield ratio-level data on the magnitude of liking/disliking of sensation equivalent to that produced by magnitude estimation (ME). The LHS was constructed by having 49 subjects who were trained in ME rate the semantic magnitudes of 10 common hedonic descriptors within a broad context of imagined hedonic experiences that included tastes and flavors. The resulting bipolar scale is statistically symmetrical around neutral and has a unique semantic structure. The LHS was evaluated quantitatively by comparing it with ME and the 9-point hedonic scale. The LHS yielded nearly identical ratings to those obtained using ME, which implies that its semantic labels are valid and that it produces ratio-level data equivalent to ME. Analyses of variance conducted on the hedonic ratings from the LHS and the 9-point scale gave similar results, but the LHS showed much greater resistance to ceiling effects and yielded normally distributed data, whereas the 9-point scale did not. These results indicate that the LHS has significant semantic, quantitative, and statistical advantages over the 9-point hedonic scale.},

abstract = {Projective mapping, also known as the nappe map technique is a method proposed for gathering similarity data in which panelists are directed to place products on a two dimensional surface. Two groups of participants, experienced chefs and consumers, performed this task and traditional attribute scaling. Ten fresh squeezed citrus juices and one commercial juice were judged along with two duplicates for a total of 13 products. Nappe map data were analyzed using multifactor analysis (MFA) and generalized procrustes analysis (GPA). Scaling data were analyzed using MFA, GPA, and principle components analysis (PCA). Configurations were generally similar, with juices differentiated by an axis opposing sweet, orange, floral and fruity characteristics against grapefruit, bitter and sour notes. A textural (pith vs. smooth) axis was also evident in some plots. Nappe configurations were similar, especially comparing GPA and MFA analyses within a group. Comparisons of configurations between groups were less similar, as shown by lower Rv coefficients. Configurations showed a good correspondence of scaled attribute results to nappe results for the consumers, but less so for the chefs, suggesting different criteria for the chefs in the nappe and scaling tasks. The nappe method may uncover perceptions not captured by traditional scaling and PCA especially for groups such as chefs, who may have more idiosyncratic perceptions of the critical sensory attributes.

The need to make valid comparisons across individuals/groups to reveal this variation highlighted invalid use of conventional labeled scales (e.g., visual analogue, category scales). Valid comparisons can be made with magnitude matching and the general Labeled Magnitude Scale (gLMS) employing multiple standards (real and remembered), thus permitting associations between oral sensation, preferences, intake (e.g., fats, vegetables), and health outcomes (e.g., cancer, phantoms, burning mouth syndrome). These measurement insights broadly apply to sensory/hedonic assessment of differences across groups in many different fields. As an illustration, we assess differences across groups experiencing different types of pain.},

Eaters had lower maximum intensities, shorter total times, and slower maximum rates of onset and decay. Judges with substantial desensitization also had shorter time-to-maximum intensities. Desensitized judges not only scored the burn of capsaicin as less intense, but also the burn of cinnamaldehyde and piperine. The burn of cinnamaldehyde solutions increased and decayed quickly; whereas, burns due to piperine and capsaicin increased and decayed slowly. Capsaicin compared to cinnamaldehyde, had time-to-max, plateau time, and total time that were 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 fold larger; whereas, the maximum rates of onset and decay were 0.7 and 0.2 fold smaller, respectively. Temporal differences are believed to reflect differences in neural pathways for the irritant species.},

In the present study we used an experimental approach to investigate sensory dominance in the product experience of freshness. We created products (soft drinks, dishwashing liquids, and scented candles) using fresh and non-fresh stimuli (colours and smells) in four different combinations and asked respondents to evaluate the freshness and pleasantness of each product. The results demonstrated that smell dominated the judgments of freshness for soft drinks and dishwashing liquids. However, for scented candles smell and colour were equally important in determining freshness. This suggests that the dominant sensory modality for the product experience of freshness depends on the characteristics of the particular product.},

Its origins have been elusive. Our objective was to test the purported hybrid derivation and parentage of V. tahitensis from aromatic, neotropical progenitors. Nucleotide sequences from V. tahitensis and neotropical Vanilla were assayed for phylogenetic relatedness in two independently inherited genomic regions, the nuclear ITS region, and the trnH-psbA noncoding region of chloroplast DNA. As predicted to occur for early generation hybrids, placement of V. tahitensis was nonconcordant. All V. tahitensis clustered with V. planifolia from analysis of cpDNA sequences, suggesting V. planifolia as the maternal genome contributor. Phylogenetic reconstruction of ITS sequences showed that most V. tahitensis nested incongruently with V. odorata, but others remained sister to V. planifolia. Recovery of ITS clones in V. tahitensis related to both V. planifolia and V. odorata also supports its biphyletic origin from these two taxa. We interpret the high percentage (95\%) of additive polymorphic sites in V. tahitensis relative to its parents as indication of a recent, and probably human-mediated, evolutionary origin.},

abstract = {This study proposes a methodology for the collection and the analysis of free-text descriptions. Our hypotheses were that the high number of words usually required in textual data analysis could be compensated by (1) the expertise of the judges; and (2) by collecting free descriptions in the context of a Napping® evaluation (Ultra-flash profiling [UFP]). This method was applied using 14 wine experts, who evaluated 10 red wines twice. The independent analysis of the words thus obtained is interpretable and rich of information. The comparison with the characterization obtained from an independent classical profiling both supports the results of the UFP and shows the specific contribution of this method. Moreover, the minimal quotation frequency from which the items were introduced in the analysis is discussed. In the present example, the robustness observed whatever the threshold selected is an argument in favor of the stability of this method. The example studied shows that it is possible to get an interpretable product space from free-text comments provided by a limited number of judges, when judges are experts and when descriptions are collected in the context of a Napping® evaluation. Beyond the example, this study proposes a methodology for the collection and the analysis of free-text comments.},

abstract = {The processes of overall similarity sorting were investigated in 5 free classification experiments. Experiments 1 and 2 demonstrated that increasing time pressure can reduce the likelihood of overall similarity categorization. Experiment 3 showed that a concurrent load also reduced overall similarity sorting. These findings suggest that overall similarity sorting can be a time-consuming analytic process. Such results appear contrary to the idea that overall similarity is a nonanalytic process (e.g., T. B. Ward, 1983) but are in line with F. N. Milton and A. J. Wills's (2004) dimensional summation hypothesis and with the stochastic sampling assumptions of the extended generalized context model (K. Lamberts, 2000). Experiments 4 and 5 demonstrated that the relationship between stimulus presentation time and overall similarity sorting is nonmonotonic, and the shape of the function is consistent with the idea that the three aforementioned processes operate over different parts of the time course.

Differences in sweetness were rated using a 150 mm continuous line scale, anchored at the extremities with 'Much less sweet' and 'Much more sweet' and at the mid-point with 'Standard'. Analysis of variance was used to examine the effects of assessors, sessions, replicates, samples and interactions. Regression lines were fitted and equi-sweet concentrations determined for each sweetener. Although the results indicated that it is more appropriate to consider an equi-sweet range for each sweetener, practical considerations necessitated the use of a single consensus concentration. Variation in the data was sweetener dependent; the more complex the total perception associated with a sweetener, the more variable the results.},

abstract = {In preference mapping, mean liking scores of the products often appear to be the resultant of diverging opinions that need to be summarized with a small number of homogeneous consumer clusters. For doing so, the common practice of most consumer research agencies is to use hierarchical clustering methods. The objective of this work is to compare this common practice with partitioning methods (e.g. k-means clustering) that we generally apply. These comparisons are made on actual Nestl\'{e} studies and on simulated datasets. For actual studies, methods are compared according to four indexes measuring the compactness and the separation of the clustering. For simulated data, the methods are compared on their ability to recover the a priori defined clusters. Results show that common partitioning methods like k-means outperform hierarchical methods for clustering consumers in preference mapping.},

Six samples, selected from thirty-two commercial rye breads, were evaluated for the intensity of twenty-nine attributes and for similarity between sample pairs. Significant differences were found between samples in the intensity of twenty-eight of these descriptors. The data were combined by a multidimensional scaling procedure (KYST 2A and PROFIT), which revealed three discriminative dimensions among the samples: (1) from pleasant rye-like to unpleasant flour-like; (2) from sweet to bitter; and (3) the presence/absence of a characteristic flavour caused by specific baking conditions (low temperature, long baking time). The PROFIT procedure identified 20 attributes as important for quality of rye bread samples using multiple correlation coefficients. There were five appearance attributes, two odour attributes, six taste attributes, five texture attributes and overall impression of pleasantness and freshness.},

abstract = {It has been demonstrated that when people free classify stimuli presented simultaneously in an array, they have a preference to categorize by a single dimension. However, when people are encouraged to categorize items sequentially, they sort by "family resemblance," grouping by overall similarity. The present studies extended this research, producing 3 main findings. First, the sequential procedure introduced by G. Regehr and L. R. Brooks (1995) does not always produce a preference for family resemblance sorts. Second, sort strategy in a sequential procedure is sensitive to subtle variations in stimulus properties. Third, spatially separable stimuli evoked more family resemblance sorts than stimuli of greater spatial integration. It is suggested that the family resemblance sorting observed is due to an analytic strategy. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Vanillin and four vanilla samples each originally at 3-fold, 10-fold and 20-fold concentration were evaluated. On average the sensory-savvy (SS) panelists did not use significantly more descriptors than the sensory-naive (SN) group. However, the terms used by the SS group were more likely to discriminate among the samples than the SN terms. Procrustes analysis indicated that the SN data did not have a true consensus space while the SS data did. The MDS data space was visually similar to the FCP space.},

abstract = {Accumulating evidence suggests dietary fatty acids (FAs) may be sensed in the oral cavity. However, the effective cues have not been characterized. In particular, influences from other sensory cues have hampered identification of an independent gustatory contribution. Experiment 1 examined techniques to minimize the formation of FA oxidation products and improve the homogeneity of water/lipid emulsions to be used as stimuli in Experiment 2, a psychophysical study to determine FA detection thresholds in humans. Through sonication of chilled samples held in polypropylene labware and the addition of 0.01\% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, calcium disodium salt, homogenous emulsions of unoxidized linoleic and oleic FAs were obtained. Spectrophotometric analysis revealed no oxidation product formation over a 24-h period. Coupled with these techniques, a masking approach was used to minimize other sensory cues imparted from linoleic, oleic, and stearic FAs. Concentration ranges from 0.00028\% to 5\% (w/v) were prepared in mixtures with 5\% mineral oil (w/v) and 5\% gum acacia (w/v) to mask lubricity and viscosity effects, respectively. Testing was conducted under red light with nares blocked to eliminate visual and olfactory cues. Oral rinses with 20 ppm capsaicin were administered to desensitize participants to selected irritation effects prior to remeasuring linoleic acid detection thresholds. To determine if the effective stimulus was an oxidation product, oxidized linoleic acid was included among the test stimuli. Detection thresholds were obtained using a 3-alternative, forced-choice ascending-concentration presentation procedure. The mean detection threshold for linoleic acid pre-desensitization was 0.034 \{+/-\} 0.008\%, for linoleic acid post-desensitization was 0.032 \{+/-\} 0.007\%, for oleic 0.022 \{+/-\} 0.003\%, for stearic 0.032 \{+/-\} 0.005\%, and oxidized linoleic 0.025 \{+/-\} 0.005\%. The results suggest that linoleic, oleic, stearic, and oxidized linoleic acids are detectable in the oral cavity of humans with minimal input from the olfactory, capsaicin, and viscosity-assessing tactile systems.},

abstract = {Preference tests were performed for varieties of potato chips, orange juices and chocolate chip cookies using three response protocols: the traditional paired preference test with the "no preference" option, a 9-point hedonic scale and a 6-point hybrid hedonic/purchase intent scale. The different stimuli to be assessed were presented in pairs, but putatively identical stimuli were also presented as a "placebo" pair. Performance on the placebo pair with identical stimuli provided a measure of the hidden demand characteristics of the test protocol. The presentation of the different pairs provided a measure of preference accompanied by such hidden demand effects. Comparison between the two allowed a better measure of preference per se. The order of presentation of the identical and different pairs did show occasional slight evidence of contrast effects. For the placebo "identical" pairs, a majority of consumers reported false preferences. Liking questions with the hedonic and hybrid scales elicited fewer false preferences than preference questions with the paired preference protocol. Yet, the effects tended to be slight. The 6-point hedonic/purchase intent scale exhibited the fewest false preferences in the placebo condition, and this was because of its fewer categories rather than any cognitive strategy change elicited by its different labels. A problem with paired preference testing is the tendency of consumers to give false preferences, which produces the seriously misleadingoverestimation of the proportion of consumers who have preferences for one or other of the products being assessed. The placebo condition is an important control for alleviating this problem. The statistical analysis can be improved by finding a protocol that maximizes the proportion of "no preference" responses in the placebo condition. The key finding here is that using hedonic or purchase intent questions rather than preference questions may possibly provide a way of achieving this aim.},

abstract = {The consumption of food and drink are among the most multisensory of our perceptual experiences. In fact, the evaluation of foodstuffs is not only influenced by the unified oral sensation (or Gestalt) of taste and smell in the mouth but also by what the foods look, feel (i.e., oral texture, temperature, viscosity, etc.), and sound like (particularly for noisy foods such as crisps, celery, carrots, etc.) when we eat or drink them. The empirical literature reviewed here highlights the important role that auditory cues have on our perception of a variety of different food and drink items. In particular, changing the sounds that are made when we bite into a foodstuff, or the sounds that are made by carbonated drinks, have both been shown to have a dramatic effect on perception. Auditory stimuli that are not even directly food-related have also been shown to influence people’s behavior. The present article reviews the growing body of research, highlighting the significant effects that music and other auditory stimuli can have on people’s food choices. Taken together, the results of the studies reported here unequivocally show that what people hear (be it food-related or nonrelated sounds) can have a dramatic effect on their perceptions of food and drink. Finally, we report a number of explanations that have been put forward in order to account for these cross-modal effects.},

Distinction between oil and cells was made possible by the addition of a fluorescent probe in the frying oil and the use of the natural fluorescence of cells. Observations were recorded at different depths and were treated to make volumetric reconstructions at different product scales. The results showed that after frying, the cellular structures were well conserved in terms of shape and size. Oil was shown to be mainly located in the first cell layer occupying around 50\% of its volume. Oil remained in the cut cells emptied during the washing or the frying operation or in the damaged cells partially filled with starch. Cell detachment, because of starch swelling and dehydration, seemed to be the preferential connection between cell layers. The positive effect of air-drying toward oil uptake reduction could be the restriction of these connections.},

Oral capsaicin partially masks gustatory and olfactory sensations, but surprisingly, it does not interfere with flavor identification Regular users rate the intensity of orally-induced irritation from capsaicin as markedly lower In spite of this difference, the partial masking of the magnitude of olfactory or gustatory sensations exerted by capsaicin is approximately equal in the two groups. There are indications that decrements in flavor identification under capsaicin are greater in chili dislikers (non-eaters). The pattern of results suggests that the masking effect of capsaicin on taste and smell arises at the stage of processing before (or on a parallel path to) the appreciation of the magnitude of the capsaicin-induced burn sensation.},

abstract = {The increased dominance of imported shrimp in the U.S. market has led to lower prices received by domestic shrimp producers. One way domestic shrimp producers might be able to receive higher prices is by marketing it as a premium product easily differentiated from imported individually quick-frozen (IQF) shrimp. Four panels covering two groups (consumers and chefs) and two cooking methods were asked to rate sensory attributes related to shrimp. Results show that consumer panels rate IQF shrimp higher than South Carolina fresh and frozen (SC fresh and frozen, respectively) shrimp across many sensory attributes. Results from the chef panels, although also indicating a number of advantages for IQF shrimp, reveal attributes where SC fresh and frozen shrimp have an edge. Flavor ratings are highly correlated with overall ratings for a particular shrimp, and this influenced a panel's shrimp preference. Future marketing efforts geared toward turning U.S. domestic shrimp into a premium product should concentrate on reintroducing domestic shrimp to U.S. consumers who have been used to imported IQF shrimp. Advantages of domestic frozen shrimp in terms of texture and appearance as noted by the chef panels should also be exploited.},

On the one hand, 150 consumers sort 26 pieces varying along 3 factors: opacifying agent, coloring agent, and grain type. Multidimensional scaling allows the perceptive dimensions to be retrieved from the similarities between the plastic pieces. A sensory interpretation of these dimensions is made possible by the consumers' verbal descriptions of their own groups. The proximity of the subjects' sorting results reveals the homogeneity of their perception of the products. On the other hand, 12 trained panelists generate and rate 8 visual attributes to describe a representative 8-piece subset of the 26 original samples, reduced to suit the descriptive analysis constraints. Eventually, both methods lead to the same conclusions in terms of piece configuration, associated perceptive interpretation and perception-process parameter relations.},

@article{Nestrud2010,
abstract = {Projective mapping, also called napping, was introduced to the chemosensory community as a multidimensional data-collection method in which panelists place products directly into a two-dimensional space based on their perceived similarity. Sorting is a form of nominal level measurement in that a pair of products is either placed in the same category or not for each subject. Analysis of projective mapping data is typically performed with multiple factor analysis, and sorting is typically performed with multidimensional scaling (MDS). This study took an exploratory empirical look at apple and cheese product systems separately in a direct comparison of sorting (analyzed by MDS) with projective mapping (analyzed with MFA). Product maps were similar for both the sorting and projective mapping procedures. Subjects had more difficulty with the apples than the cheeses. Cluster analysis was easier to interpret for the napping configurations. Sorting has already gained wide use in such areas of applied sensory science as competitive evaluation, flavor exploration and category appraisals, among others. Projective mapping, also known as the napping method, was introduced relatively recently to the sensory community and has already gained much interest. It may have certain advantages or disadvantages of sorting and, at least in theory, can be applied in the same situations. This paper provides a comparison of projective mapping and sorting, and illustrates some of the differences and advantages/disadvantages of each method. It provides examples of the types of data analysis that can be used for each method. Based on this study, we conclude that projective mapping may have advantages over sorting where the product space contains relatively similar products, such as different apples or cheddar cheeses. Cluster analysis enriches the projective mapping interpretation by helping differentiate product groupings.},

One group divided the set into as many categories as they wished, while a second group was restricted to sorting into only two categories. The number of times a given odor pair was sorted into the same group was counted as an index of similarity and submitted to multidimensional scaling (MDS). The restricted group produced an MDS configuration with only two clusters (woody and citrus), with ambiguous odors on the edges of each cluster. The unrestricted group produced four clusters, with lime fragrances and ambiguous odors falling into a central cluster between woody and citrus groups. The sorting task offers a potential shortcut in generating data for MDS analysis that can be used for perceptual mapping of odor classes. However, the complexity of the resulting configurations depends upon the restrictions imposed on subjects during sorting.},

The "depth median" is the deepest location, and it is surrounded by a "bag" containing the n/2 observations with largest depth. Magnifying the bag by a factor 3 yields the "fence" (which is not plotted). Observations between the bag and the fence are marked by a light gray loop, whereas observations outside the fence are flagged as outliers. The bagplot visualizes the location, spread, correlation, skewness, and tails of the data. It is equivariant for linear transformations, and not limited to elliptical distributions. Software for drawing the bagplot is made available for the S-Plus and MATLAB environments. The bagplot is illustrated on several datasets-for example, in a scatterplot matrix of multivariate data.},

abstract = {Objective: To investigate the effects of regular chilli ingestion on some indicators of metabolic and vascular function.
Design: A randomized cross-over dietary intervention study.
Setting: Launceston, Australia.
Subjects: Healthy free-living individuals.

Intervention: Thirty-six participants (22 women and 14 men), aged 46plusminus12 (meanplusminuss.d.) years; BMI 26.4plusminus4.8 kg/m2, consumed 30 g/day of a chilli blend (55\% cayenne chilli) with their normal diet (chilli diet), and a bland diet (chilli-free) for 4 weeks each. Metabolic and vascular parameters, including plasma glucose, serum lipids and lipoproteins, insulin, basal metabolic rate, blood pressure, heart rate, augmentation index (AIx; an indicator of arterial stiffness), and subendocardial-viability ratio (SEVR; a measure of myocardial perfusion), were measured at the end of each diet. In a sub-study, during week 3 of each dietary period, the vascular responses of 15 subjects to glyceryl-trinitrate (GTN) and salbutamol were also studied.

Results:For the whole group, there were no significant differences between any of the measured parameters when compared at the end of the two dietary periods. When analysed separately, men had a lower resting heart rate (P=0.02) and higher SEVR (P=0.05) at the end of the chilli diet than the bland diet. In the sub-study, baseline AIx on the chilli diet was lower (P<0.001) than on the bland diet, but there was no difference in the effects of GTN and salbutamol between the two diets.

Conclusion: Four weeks of regular chilli consumption has no obvious beneficial or harmful effects on metabolic parameters but may reduce resting heart rate and increase effective myocardial perfusion pressure time in men.},

This involved heat treatment of each of these spices by: (i) boiling for 10 min, (ii) boiling for 20 min and (iii) pressure cooking for 10 min. Quantitation of the spice principles in the organic solvent extracts of the freeze-dried cooked spice samples was made with an appropriate HPLC method. Significant loss of spice active principles was observed when the spices were subjected to heat processing. Curcumin loss from heat processing of turmeric was 27-53\%, with maximum loss in pressure cooking for 10 min. Curcumin loss from turmeric was similar even in the presence of red gram. In the presence of tamarind, the loss of Curcumin from turmeric was 12-30\%. Capsaicin losses from red pepper ranged from 18\% to 36\%, with maximum loss observed in pressure cooking. Presence of either red gram or tamarind or both did not influence the loss of capsaicin. Piperine losses from black pepper ranged from 16\% to 34\%, with maximum loss observed in pressure cooking. The loss was somewhat lower in the presence of red gram. The results of this investigation indicated diminished availability of spice active principles from cooked foods when the food ingredients have been subjected to either boiling or pressure cooking for few minutes.},

abstract = {There are few data on the psychophysical properties of zingerone, one of the pungent components in ginger, particularly in contrast to capsaicin. The time-intensity characteristics of zingerone irritation were examined using high-frequency, intermediate-frequency, and low-frequency users of chili, who rated the intensity of whole-mouth rinses of 1\% zingerone at 6-s intervals for 3 min. Maximum intensity was reached within the first 20 s, while the zingerone was in the mouth. At this stage, there were no differences between groups. Following expectoration at 30 s, frequent users showed a more rapid decline in rated intensity than did intermediate users, who showed a more rapid decline than infrequent users. Capsaicin sensitization and desensitization are dependent upon the interstimulus intervals (ISIs) used. A second experiment, also using groups of high-, intermediate-, and low-frequency chili users, examined whether sensitization to zingerone could be demonstrated using ISIs based on the point of maximum intensity observed in the first study. In contrast to sensitization effects found with capsaicin, slight desensitization was observed over 10 successive zingerone stimuli. Following a 5-min hiatus in stimulation, further desensitization was apparent. These results point to the ability of zingerone to self-desensitize, although the effect is of a smaller magnitude than that of capsaicin. None of these effects varied as a function of chili use. Analysis of the qualities that constituted zingerone irritation found that the sensations produced are predominantly burning and warmth, making it qualitatively similar to capsaicin.},

abstract = {The concept of sensory distance between products is familiar. It is used mainly in graphical displays, for example provided by principal components analysis carried out from conventional profiles. In such a methodology, the importance (or weight) granted to the descriptors by the subjects is not taken into account in the averaging process. To take into account these weights, two practices can classically be used: similarity scaling and multidimensional sorting. Here a third way is proposed: the direct collection of perceived inter-products distance by each subject. In this method, each subject is asked to position the products onto a large sheet of paper according to the sensory distances he perceives between the products. Thus, for each subject, the data consist in a bi-dimensional configuration of the products. These configurations can be analysed by multiple factor analysis. This procedure is described here and applied to 10 white wines from the Loire Valley; the results are interpreted with the help of a classical descriptive sensory analysis.},

The level of total saturated fatty acids (SFA) was higher in HO than in AG hams, whereas total monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) showed higher proportions in AG than in HO Iberian dry-cured hams. Besides, lower levels of the n-6/n-3 ratio were found in AG than in HO dry-cured hams. Sensory analyses only showed differences between AG and HO Iberian dry-cured hams in pastiness (higher in AG hams, p=0.039) and marbling (lower in AG ham, p=0.002). Pig feeding also leads to differences in two computational texture features obtained by MRI-based analysis. Thus, analysis of the fatty acid profile and MRI-based analysis might be used for classifying dry-cured hams from pigs fattened with different diets.},

@article{Pickering2009,
abstract = {A methodology based on descriptive analysis techniques used in the evaluation of human food has been successfully refined to allow for a human taste panel to profile the flavour and texture of a range of cat food products (CFP) and their component parts. Included in this method is the development of evaluation protocols for homogeneous products and for binary samples containing both meat chunk (MC) and gravy/gel (GG) constituents. Using these techniques, 18 flavour attributes (sweet, sour/acid, tuna, herbal, spicy, soy, salty, cereal, caramel, chicken, methionine, vegetable, offaly, meaty, burnt flavour, prawn, rancid and bitter) and four texture dimensions (hardness, chewiness, grittiness and viscosity) were generated to describe the sensations elicited by 13 commercial pet food samples. These samples differed in intensity for 16 of the 18 flavour attributes, which allows for individual CFP flavour profiles to be developed. Principal components analysis (PCA) could successfully discriminate between samples within the PCA space and also reveal some groupings amongst them. While many flavour attributes were weakly correlated, a large number (describing both taste and retro-nasal aroma qualities) were required to adequately differentiate between samples, suggesting considerable complexity in the products assessed. For both MC and GG, differences between samples for each of the texture dimensions were also found. For MC, grittiness appears to be the most discriminating textural attribute, while for GG viscosity discriminates well between samples. Meat chunks and gravy/gels differed significantly from each other in both flavour and texture. Cat food products differed in their liking ratings, although no differences were found between homogeneous, MC and GG samples, and eight flavour attributes were correlated with overall liking scores. It is now necessary to determine the usefulness and limits of sensory data gathered from human panels in describing and predicting food acceptance and preference behaviours in cats. For instance, while the sense of taste in cats appears generally similar to that of other mammals, they lack a sweet taste receptor (Li et al., 2006), which may limit the applicability of sweetness ratings obtained from humans. Modification of existing techniques used with human food research, such as external preference mapping (Naes and Risvik, 1996) may be useful. Ultimately, this may facilitate more economical and efficient methods for optimizing cat food flavour and texture and predicting the effects of composition and processing changes on cat feeding behaviour. This will require collaboration between pet food manufacturers and nutritionists, animal behaviourists and human sensory scientists. The results of this preliminary study should assist in this process.},

The primary pungent compound, hydroxy-[alpha]-sanshool (HO-[alpha]-S), altered the levels of spontaneous activity in cool-sensitive fibers as well as inducing activity in tactile fibers, cold nociceptors and silent fibers that were insensitive to innocuous thermal or tactile stimuli. Moreover, tactile or thermal sensitivity was induced in fibers that were initially insensitive to touch or cooling. The neuronal distribution of sensitivities to capsaicin and to HO-[alpha]-S indicate that this compound affects neurons mediating innocuous sensations. HO-[alpha]-S may be useful as a model stimulus for studies of paresthesia.},

Students were told to either consider eating the meals at home or at school. Forty-two different meals were selected from a pool of unique meals created by students in a previous study. The meals differed in head component, the presence or absence of vegetables, and the number of different foodstuffs. On average, approximately half of the meals were deemed acceptable, but older students accepted more meals than younger ones, boys accepted more meals than girls, and meals to be consumed at home were accepted more than those to be consumed at school. In addition, students tended to accept meals comprised of a small number of foodstuffs that did not contain vegetables. The also chose more meat-based meals over those containing fish or soup. These results suggest that students have rather unique food preferences that do not correspond well with nutritional standards. In order to address this problem we recommended that students be given more good choices in the school cafeteria through the introduction of a two-meal system and salad bars.},

Neither capsazepine, a vanilloid receptor antagonist, nor bis-(o-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid/acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA/AM), an intracellular Ca2+ chelator, significantly inhibited the capsaicin-induced apoptosis, although capsaicin increased intracellular Ca2+ level. Capsaicin markedly reduced the basal generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation. Exogenous application of H2O2 significantly prevented the cells from the apoptosis by capsaicin. Treatment with N-acetyl cysteine alone induced both reduction of the basal production of ROS and apoptosis. Taken together, these results suggest that capsaicin induced apoptosis in A172 cells and that vanilloid receptors and intracellular Ca2+ may not be involved in the apoptotic mechanism of capsaicin. Reduction of the basal generation of ROS may play a role in the induction of apoptosis by capsaicin.},

abstract = {Capsaicin is an organic compound in chili peppers which are consumed by over one quarter of the world's population daily. Studies have shown that capsaicin can induce apoptosis in some cancer cells by unknown mechanisms. In this study, both gastric cancer and normal epithelial cells were treated with capsaicin and examined for apoptosis by Annexin V binding. Our results showed that capsaicin induces apoptosis in both cells, although cancer cells are more susceptible. This susceptibility is dependent on the availability of TRPV6, a calcium-selective channel protein, as overexpression of TRPV6 in normal cells increased capsaicin-induced apoptosis and knockdown of TRPV6 in cancer cells suppressed this action. Our results further demonstrated that capsaicin increases mitochondrial permeability through activation of Bax and p53 in a JNK-dependent manner. Conclusions: (1) TRPV6, rather than TRPV1 (the well-known capsaicin receptor), mediates capsaicin-induced apoptosis in gastric cells; (2) abundance of TRPV6 in gastric cells determines their live or death under capsaicin treatment; and (3) capsaicin induces apoptosis by stabilization of p53 through JNK activation. Together, our data suggest that capsaicin may be a promising dietary candidate for cancer chemoprevention.},

After sorting cheeses, intuitively sensible perceptual maps were obtained from MDS with low stress. Duplicate cheeses and those with highly similar characteristics were plotted close together. Regression of attribute scale data into the space revealed major dimensions corresponding to flavor and texture attributes (e.g. smooth and soft vs. firm and crumbly). Two consumer groups, one experienced and knowledgeable about cheeses and the other a group of cheese consumers with no special knowledge, training or expertise, participated. Data from the two knowledge groups were similar, except that the more knowledgeable group had a larger number of significant attributes when regressed through the MDS space for blue cheeses. The sorting task was rapid and simple for participants. The overall result substantiates the applicability of the MDS/sorting technique for perceptual modeling of food categories.},

Capsaicin (8-methyl-N- vanillyl-6-nonenamide) is a quinone that has been shown to regulate a wide variety of activities that require NF-kappa B activation. In the present study, we examined the effect of capsaicin and its analogue, resiniferatoxin, on the activation of NF-kappa B induced by different agents including TNF. The pretreatment of human myeloid ML-1a cells with capsaicin blocked TNF-mediated activation of NF-kappa B in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Resiniferatoxin was at least eight times as potent as capsaicin in inhibiting NF-kappa B activation. Neither agent by itself activated NF-kappa B or affected the DNA-binding ability of NF-kappa B. Capsaicin also blocked phorbol ester-mediated NF-kappa B activation, but that mediated through okadaic acid was less effective, suggesting there is a difference in the mechanism of activation of NF- kappa B by different agents. Capsaicin treatment of cells also blocked the degradation of I kappa B alpha, and thus the nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-kappa B, which is essential for NF-kappa B activation. TNF-dependent promoter activity of I kappa B alpha, which contains NF-kappa B binding sites, was also inhibited by capsaicin. Overall our results indicate that capsaicin and its analogue inhibit NF- kappa B activation, and thus could be used as a potential target for drug development},

abstract = {Does what we hear influence our perception of, and behaviors toward, food and drink? If so, what are the mechanism(s) underlying these cross-modal effects? While many people intuitively believe that our sense of hearing has little influence on our experiences of foodstuffs, the evidence that has been published to date suggests that this is not always the case. In this article, we review the growing body of empirical research demonstrating that what we hear can affect our perception of, and responses to, food and drink. We review both laboratory-based research and real-world (ecological) studies of the effects of music and other auditory stimuli on people's food-related behaviors. This research has revealed that what we hear (be it music, the sounds we make while eating, or even pure tones or bursts of white noise) can have a dramatic effect on our perceptions of food and drink. Auditory stimuli influence people's consumption rates, their preference ratings and their flavor assessments, and have even been shown to significantly impact on the overall amount that people consume. We highlight a number of explanations, including multisensory integration, attention, associative learning and expectations, that have all been put forward in order to account for these cross-modal effects. This manuscript examines the relationship between what people hear and their food and drink experiences, perceptions and behaviors. In previous research, auditory cues have been shown to influence people's purchasing decisions, flavor evaluations and their consumption rates of food and drink. The multisensory approach inherent to this line of research provides a means of enhancing culinary experiences for people in the years to come. In fact, some important practical interventions have already been made. For example, the Fat Duck restaurant in Bray, England serves a "sounds of the sea" seafood dish. Those who select this dish are presented with a plate of seafood that is reminiscent of a beach, with an iPod (hidden in a seashell with the earphones poking out) that plays a "sounds of the sea" soundtrack. Innovations such as these, based on a solid understanding of the cognitive psychology and neuroscience of multisensory integration, may increasingly help to heighten our enjoyment and experience of food and drink.},

abstract = {Nine wine experts tasted in replicate six Chardonnay wines that had been aged in oak barrels from different forests and/or species. They freely gave their descriptions in writing; the only instruction given was to underline three words or expressions that best characterized each tasted wine. The texts were submitted to an objective lexical analysis that quantified the important variation among the experts. In addition a matching task was performed by 117 assessors in which each assessor received from each expert six white cards and six yellow cards representing the descriptions of the six white wines and six red wines. The assessors were incapable of matching the descriptions for the same expert. Comparison between the observed distribution of the number of correct matching and the expected random distribution leads to significant differences, but with a tendency in the direction of false matching: the number of 0 and 1 correct matches is too high and, conversely, the number of 2, 3 and 4 correct matches is too low, in comparison to chance. Our conclusion is that, in order to become a useful technique in food science, the free-description of food qualities given by experts requires in-depth methodological examination.},

Poor panel performance is measured after the fact and often arrives too late to help the panel leader during training sessions. The feedback calibration method (FCM) optimizes proficiency by ensuring efficient panel training. A previously trained panel (Panel T) and an untrained panel (Panel U) developed and refined their own training targets using FCM before evaluating 20 white wines in triplicate. Permutation tests of the RV coefficient were used to compare the panels in terms of the underlying sensory space. The results of the panels were similar, and both Panel T and U were superior to a proficient conventionally trained red wine panel (Panel D). Panel U performed similarly to Panel T on proportion of attributes discriminated and disagreement using a two-way mixed-model analysis of variance (ANOVA) and on multivariate discrimination evaluated by a MANOVA with the same mixed model. Evaluation means for product * attribute fell within the training range targets in 59\% of the cases for Panel T and 69\% for Panel U, providing an indication of the panels' abilities to hit the training targets. Panel U was shown to be proficient in discriminating a full range of wine attributes (p = 0.05) after only nine formal training sessions (22.5 h), a reduction in training time of 49\%.},

abstract = {Recent studies that have compared CT or MRI images of an individual's nasal anatomy and measures of their olfactory sensitivity have found a correlation between specific anatomical areas and performance on olfactory assessments. Using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques, we have developed a method to quickly (<few days) convert nasal CT scans from an individual patient into an anatomically accurate 3-D numerical nasal model that can be used to predict airflow and odorant transport, which may ultimately determine olfactory sensitivity. The 3-D model can be also be rapidly modified to depict various anatomical deviations, such as polyps and their removal, that may alter nasal airflow and impair olfactory ability. To evaluate the degree to which variations in critical nasal areas such as the olfactory slit and nasal valve can alter airflow and odorant transport, inspiratory and expiratory airflow with odorants were simulated using numerical finite volume methods. Results suggest that anatomical changes in the olfactory region (upper meatus below the cribriform plate) and the nasal valve region will strongly affect airflow patterns and odorant transport through the olfactory region, with subsequent effects on olfactory function. The ability to model odorant transport through individualized models of the nasal passages holds promise for relating anatomical deviations to generalized or selective disturbances in olfactory perception and may provide important guidance for treatments for nasal-sinus disease, occupational rhinitis and surgical interventions that seek to optimize airflow and improve deficient olfactory function.},

Subjects were scanned while exposed either to odors or colors in isolation or to color-odor combinations that were rated on the basis of how well they were perceived to match. Activity in caudal regions of the orbitofrontal cortex and in the insular cortex increased progressively with the perceived congruency of the odor-color pairs. These findings demonstrate the neuronal correlates of olfactory response modulation by color cues in brain areas previously identified as encoding the hedonic value of smells.},

abstract = {Capsaicin (trans-8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide), a natural product of Capsicum species, is known to induce excitation of nociceptive terminals involved in pain perception. Recent studies have also shown that capsaicin not only has chemopreventive properties against certain carcinogens and mutagens but also exerts anticancer activity. Here, we demonstrated the antiangiogenic activity of capsaicin using in vitro and in vivo assay systems. In vitro, capsaicin inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) -induced proliferation, DNA synthesis, chemotactic motility, and capillary-like tube formation of primary cultured human endothelial cells. Capsaicin inhibited both VEGF-induced vessel sprouting in rat aortic ring assay and VEGF-induced vessel formation in the mouse Matrigel plug assay. Moreover, capsaicin was able to suppress tumor-induced angiogenesis in chick chorioallantoic membrane assay. Capsaicin caused G1 arrest in endothelial cells. This effect correlated with the down-regulation of the expression of cyclin D1 that led to inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 4-mediated phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein. Signaling experiments show that capsaicin inhibits VEGF-induced p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, p125FAK, and AKT activation, but its molecular target is distinct from the VEGF receptor KDR/Flk-1. Taken together, these results demonstrate that capsaicin is a novel inhibitor of angiogenesis and suggest that it may be valuable to develop pharmaceutical drugs for treatment of angiogenesis-dependent human diseases such as tumors.},

However, it is impossible to assess by the RV value alone whether or not the two sets of variables are significantly correlated, which is why a test is required. Asymptotic tests do exist but fail in many situations, hence the interest in permutation tests. However, the main drawbacks of the permutation tests are that they are time consuming. It is therefore interesting to approximate the permutation distribution with continuous distributions (without doing any permutation). The current approximations (normal approximation, a log-transformation and Pearson type III approximation) are discussed and a new one is described: an Edgeworth expansion. Finally, these different approximations are compared for both simulations and for a sensory example.},

abstract = {Our experience of flavour involves integration of multiple sensory inputs, and the hedonic evaluation of this complex flavour experience is important in determination of food choice. The appearance of food also generates expectations about food flavour, and past work suggests that these expectations if confirmed enhance the flavour experience. What is less clear is what happens when cues prior to ingestion predict a flavour which is in marked contrast to the actual flavour characteristics. To test this, we conducted three experiments where expectations about food flavour were generated by plausible but inaccurate food labels for a highly novel food, smoked-salmon ice-cream. In Experiment 1, the experience of the food in the mouth generated strong dislike when labelled as ice-cream, but acceptance when labelled as frozen savoury mousse. Labelling the food as ice-cream also resulted in stronger ratings of how salty and savoury the food was than when labelled as a savoury food. Experiment 2 confirmed these findings, and also found that an uninformative label also resulted in acceptable liking ratings. Experiment 3 explicitly tested the effect of labels on flavour expectation, and confirmed that the ice-cream label generated strong expectations of a sweet, fruity flavour, consistent with the visual appearance of the ice-cream, but in marked contrast to the flavour of salty fish. As in Experiments 1 and 2, liking was minimal when the food was tasted after the ice-cream label condition, but liking was acceptable in the other label conditions. These data show that the contrast between expected and actual sensory qualities can result in a strong negative affective response and enhancement of the unexpected sensory qualities.},

Fechner maintains that all measurement, including mental measurement, rests on the principle that n magnitudes that are judged equal may be added and result in a magnitude n times as large as the individual magnitudes. He concedes that bisection methods fulfill this principle as well as just noticeable differences. Weber's law is not a necessary precondition of mental measurement; its validity is an empirical question rather than a matter of principle. The differential threshold is not an inherent property of sensation or attention, but depends on the unavoidable spatio-temporal noncoincidence of stimuli and of the sensations corresponding to them. Given this presupposition and assigning a value of zero to the absolute threshold, it is possible to arrive at a scale of sensation differences, and thus of sensations, from a scale of difference sensations.},

abstract = {Three experiments with a total of 113 college students showed that, in a paired-associate paradigm using odors as stimuli and pictures for multiple-choice responses, the 1st of 2 associations to an odor was retained far better than the 2nd over a 2-wk period. Results suggest that the persistence of first-learned associations may be responsible for the long-lasting nature of odor memories. Ss reported constructing mediational schemes for mnemonic devices to link the odors and pictures. Latencies for a task of naming odors indicated that although naming odors is difficult, labels could be generated sufficiently fast that they could be employed as mediators in the paired-associate task. A 3rd task investigated the phenomenon of knowing that an odor was familiar but being unable to name it. Ss in this "tip-of-the-nose" state were questioned about the odor quality and the name of the odor and were given hints about the name. These Ss were found to have information available about the odor quality but none for the name as found in the tip-of-the-tongue state. However, as in the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon, hints given to the Ss in the tip-of-the-nose state often led to the correct name.},

Factor recovery was assessed in terms of pattern congruence coefficients, factor score correlations, Heywood cases, and the gap size between eigenvalues. A subsampling study was also conducted on a psychological dataset of individuals who filled in a Big Five Inventory via the Internet. Results showed that when data are well conditioned (i.e., high \^{I}», low <i>f</i>, high <i>p</i>), EFA can yield reliable results for <i>N</i> well below 50, even in the presence of small distortions.

These analyses show that the two panels give similar results with respect to the important criteria for panels (discrimination, consensus, reproducibility). The comparison of the two products spaces shows high similarity. From the confidence ellipses, it can be concluded that no significant differences exist for a given product between the two panels.

Principal component analysis of quantitative descriptive data and multidimensional scaling of sorting results led to similar product maps and sensory description, even if slightly more detailed in quantitative descriptive analysis. Second, we examined if sorting performed by trained and untrained panelists led to the same conclusions. The perceptual organisation was similar whatever the level of panelist expertise. Finally, we investigated if sorting by untrained panelists led to consistent data. Familiarisation with the procedure and the products did not induce any major change. The results showed that sorting combined with verbalisation led to meaningful and consistent product sensory mapping, whatever the panelist's level of training.},

@article{Small2004,
abstract = {Flavor perception arises from the central integration of peripherally distinct sensory inputs (taste, smell, texture, temperature, sight, and even sound of foods). The results from psychophysical and neuroimaging studies in humans are converging with electrophysiological findings in animals and a picture of the neural correlates of flavor processing is beginning to emerge. Here we used event-related fMRI to evaluate brain response during perception of flavors (i.e., taste/odor liquid mixtures not differing in temperature or texture) compared with the sum of the independent presentation of their constituents (taste and/or odor). All stimuli were presented in liquid form so that olfactory stimulation was by the retronasal route. Mode of olfactory delivery is important because neural suppression has been observed in chemosensory regions during congruent taste-odor pairs when the odors are delivered by the orthonasal route and require subjects to sniff. There were 2 flavors. One contained a familiar/congruent taste-odor pair (vanilla/sweet) and the other an unfamiliar/incongruent taste-odor pair (vanilla/salty). Three unimodal stimuli, including 2 tastes (sweet and salty) and one odor (vanilla), as well as a tasteless/odorless liquid (baseline) were presented. Superadditive responses during the perception of the congruent flavor compared with the sum of its constituents were observed in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), dorsal insula, anterior ventral insula extending into the caudal orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), frontal operculum, ventral lateral prefrontal cortex, and posterior parietal cortex. These regions were not present in a similar analysis of the incongruent flavor compared with the sum of its constituents. All of these regions except the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex were also isolated in a direct contrast of congruent - incongruent. Additionally, the anterior cingulate, posterior parietal cortex, frontal operculum, and ventral insula/caudal OFC were also more active in vanilla + salty minus incongruent, suggesting that delivery of an unfamiliar taste-odor combination may lead to suppressed neural responses. Taken together with previous findings in the literature, these results suggest that the insula, OFC, and ACC are key components of the network underlying flavor perception and that taste-smell integration within these and other regions is dependent on 1) mode of olfactory delivery and 2) previous experience with taste/smell combinations.},

Levels of serum cholesterol and pre-\{beta\}-lipoprotein were not affected by the supplementation of capsaicin. The perirenal adipose tissue weight was lower when capsaicin was present in the diet than when it was not. Hepatic enzyme activities of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and adipose lipoprotein lipase were lower in rats fed the 30\% lard diet than in those fed a nonpurified diet. Activities of these two enzymes were higher when capsaicin was added to the diet than when it was not. Hepatic acetyl-CoA carboxylase, \{beta\}-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and adipose hormone-sensitive lipase activities were not affected by capsaicin feeding. Lipid absorption was not affected by the supplementation of capsaicin. The perirenal adipose tissue weight and serum triglyceride were decreased as the level of capsaicin in the diet increased up to 0.021\%. These results suggest that capsaicin stimulates lipid mobilization from adipose tissue and lowers the perirenal adipose tissue weight and serum triglyceride concentration in lard-fed rats.},

Cherry tomato released more (E)-2-hexenal, (Z)-3-hexenal, and 1-penten-3-one than tomatillo, Roma tomato, and vine-ripened tomato during chewing. The proportion of the average concentration of volatiles in the mouthspace after swallowing to before swallowing (MSas/MSbs) varied from 2.8\% to 73.9\% between different volatiles and varieties. Methylbutanal, hexanal, and nonanal were retained at a higher percentage in the mouth after swallowing than (Z)-3-hexenal, (E)-2-hexenal, 1-penten-3-one, and isobutyl alcohol. The proportion of the average volatile concentration in the mouthspace, to the headspace in a glass container (MS/HS) of 1-penten-3-one, hexanal, methylbutanal, and nonanal, and the proportion of nosespace to headspace (NS/HS) for 1-penten-3-one, hexanal, (Z)-3-hexenal, and nonanal was significantly higher in tomatillo than in tomatoes. There was no difference between tomatoes of different varieties in NS/HS ratio. Practical Application: The real-time volatile release from tomatillos and tomatoes was measured and compared. The information obtained on the dynamic generation of volatile compounds provides a better understanding of volatile release in the headspace of tomatillo and tomatoes. The compounds and their volatile release patterns were similar for the tomatillo and tomatoes. The green aldehydes released during chewing were not significantly higher than most tomato varieties, except for Roma tomatoes. Cherry tomato released relatively more volatiles during chewing, whereas Roma tomatoes were generally poor in mouthspace volatiles. The lingering of volatiles in the mouth after swallowing was different for different volatiles and varieties, which may appear as a sensory difference detected by consumers.},

abstract = {Capsaicin, a major ingredient of hot pepper, was considered to exhibit an anti-inflammatory property. In order to clarify the signalling mechanism underlying the anti-inflammatory action of capsaicin, we investigated the effect of capsaicin on the production of inflammatory molecules in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated murine peritoneal macrophages. The level of PGE2 was measured by EIA. The expression levels of COX-2, iNOS, IkB-a, and vanilloid receptor-1 (VR-1) were determined at the protein and mRNA levels. Significant inhibition of the production of LPS-induced PGE2 by capsaicin was observed in a dose-dependent manner. Capsaicin did not affect the COX-2 expression at either the protein or mRNA level, but inhibited the enzyme activity of COX-2 and the expression of the iNOS protein. Capsaicin completely blocked LPS-induced disappearance of IkB-a and therefore inactivated NF-kB. The inhibitory action of capsaicin on PGE2 production was not abolished by capsazepine, a specific antagonist to VR-1. A high expression level of the VR-1 like protein (VRL-1) was observed in peritoneal macrophages, while the expression of VR-1 was not detected. These findings suggest that the anti-inflammatory action of capsaicin may occur through a novel mechanism, not by a VR-1 receptor-mediated one. Both capsaicin and capsazepine may be a promising drug candidates for ameliorating inflammatory diseases and cancer.},

abstract = {The primary sensory tool for specifying the characteristics of a complex aroma, fragrance, flavor or other odorous mixture of volatiles is descriptive analysis. Descriptive analysis uses a trained panel to specify the intensities of specific attributes, based on a psychophysical model for intensity scaling. However, the use of descriptive techniques for complex and well-blended aromas gives rise to several problems. The psychophysical intensity model based upon independent odor notes may be a poor way to characterize odor experience, bringing into question whether descriptive analysis is an adequate tool for sensory analysis of complex smells. These problems include the following: (1) disagreement among experts in the most prominent odor notes of a single product and other individual differences problems, (2) a correspondence between similarity scaling and intensity scaling, (3) the substitution of applicability measures for intensity, (4) the need to use mid-tier, general odor terms for profiling complex fragrances, and (5) blending and integration effects. Data will be presented on citrus-woody mixtures showing that ratings of similarity and intensity are highly correlated, suggesting a common underlying process for both ratings. A related issue concerns whether odors and their mixtures are perceived as unitary or analyzable percepts. With these same stimuli, the perception of singularity vs. mixed-ness of stimuli is difficult to predict. Sensory scientists should question the validity of descriptive data for such stimuli and avoid the simplistic mistake of equating data with perception. The use of simple and apparently independent intensity scales may produce the illusion that the odor experience is a collection of independent analyzable "notes" when it is not. ©},

Nosofsky's (1986) exacting tests corroborate fundamental aspects of the author's (1955, see also PA, Vol 33:5134) earlier theory of identification and classification, his results also appear to disconfirm the assumptions that generalization falls off exponentially with psychological distance between stimuli and that psychological distance approximates the city-block metric if the dimensions of the stimuli are separable. It is conjectured that Nosofsky's discordant results may depend on his use of extensive discrimination training with highly similar stimuli and, therefore, reflect the limiting noise of discriminal processes more than the postulated cognitive mechanism of generalization.

abstract = {SUMMARY1. We analysed an existing database of macroinvertebrates and fish in the context of a newly established geographical information system (GIS) of physical features to determine the relationships between stream community composition and physical factors measured at three landscape scales 2013 catchment, reach and bedform. Both an exploratory (concordance analysis) and a predictive (ausrivas) approach were used. 2. The environmental variables that most successfully accounted for variation in macroinvertebrate assemblages were mainly 'natural' and at the catchment-scale (relief ratio, basin diameter, etc.) but the human-induced physical setting of percentage of pasture in the riparian zone was also influential. For fish, 'natural' variables were also dominant, but these were mostly at the bedform or reach scales and land use featured strongly. 3. Geographic location accounted for some of the variation in invertebrate assemblages, partly because geography and influential conditions/resources are correlated but also because different species may have evolved in different places and have not colonised every 'ecologically appropriate' location. Geographic location was not influential in accounting for variation in assemblages of strongly flying invertebrates, supporting the hypothesis that organisms having high dispersal potential can be expected to break down geographic barriers more readily than those with poor dispersal powers. In accord with what is known about the local evolution and restricted distributions of native and exotic species, history (reflected in geography) appeared to account for some variation in fish assemblages. 4. Given their different mathematical bases, the fact that exploratory and predictive analyses yielded similar results provides added confidence to our conclusions.},

abstract = {Awareness of how important food and food culture are to the quality of children's life is a presupposition that promotes research in the sector of school lunch. The aim of this work was to evaluate liking for meals supplied to primary school refectories of the Municipality of Milan. It appears particularly interesting to investigate consumption of meals in Italy in view of both food combinations and the nutritional aspect of the Mediterranean diet. In addition, meals are typically subdivided into four distinct components in Italy. All the children (120) involved, aged between 7 and 10, supplied liking scores as shown in a previous work [Italian J. Food Sci. 2 (2003) 215] for a set of first courses, second courses, vegetables and fruit/dessert. From results it can be seen that preferences for most dishes of younger children (7 years old) differed from those of the older ones (10 years old). Also, unlike 8-, 9- and 10-year-old children, 7-year-old children supplied steadily higher acceptability scores than the intermediate score on the evaluation scale used. Based on our data, it was shown that children become increasingly aware of their preferences and critical in their choices with growing age.},

abstract = {In the wine industry, characterisation is usually performed by wine professionals. However, the methods classically used in sensory analysis appear to be little adapted to this type of jury: winemakers are not unavailable per se but often not suitable as sensory panellists for extended studies by researchers. A method called Napping® was developed recently. This method seems to be more relevant to the wine profession because of its spontaneous aspect and its flexibility. However, Napping® itself does not characterise the products and has to be completed with a descriptive method. The aim of this study was to compare three methods to complete a wine Napping®: a conventional profile, taken as reference, and two simplified profiles (ultra-flash profile, UFP, and free profile, FP). Data were treated by hierarchical multiple factor analysis. Results show that all methods underlined the same main characteristics. The data collection from UFP is partly arbitrary, but this method is the least time-consuming and easily provided wine characterisations. It appeared here to be a good complement to Napping® and to be well adapted to wine professionals when a rough description is expected.},

abstract = {Capsaicin (N-vanillyl-8-methyl-1-nonenamide) is a homovanillic acid derivative found in pungent fruits. Several investigators have reported the ability of capsaicin to inhibit events associated with the promotion of cancer. However, the effects of capsaicin on human leukemic cells have never been investigated. We investigated the effects of capsaicin on leukemic cells in vitro and in vivo and further examined the molecular mechanisms of capsaicin-induced apoptosis in myeloid leukemic cells. Capsaicin suppressed the growth of leukemic cells, but not normal bone marrow mononuclear cells, via induction of G0-G1 phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Capsaicin-induced apoptosis was in association with the elevation of intracellular reactive oxygen species production. Interestingly, capsaicin-sensitive leukemic cells were possessed of wild-type p53, resulting in the phosphorylation of p53 at the Ser-15 residue by the treatment of capsaicin. Abrogation of p53 expression by the antisense oligonucleotides significantly attenuated capsaicin-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Pretreatment with the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cystein and catalase, but not superoxide dismutase, completely inhibited capsaicin-induced apoptosis by inhibiting phosphorylation of Ser-15 residue of p53. Moreover, capsaicin effectively inhibited tumor growth and induced apoptosis in vivo using NOD/SCID mice with no toxic effects. We conclude that capsaicin has potential as a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of leukemia.},

Selection of variables to preserve multivariate data structure, using principal components. Applied Statistics, 36(1), 22-33]. An application in the field of sensory science is presented in this paper. The method selects the subset from all possible subsets by matching the multidimensional configuration of objects of the subset to the full set of variables. To this end a Procrustes rotation is used and the subset which produces the lowest Procrustes loss in this matching is selected as the optimal subset. For two data sets the loss values of all possible subsets of all possible sizes are studied. It is concluded that considering the subsets corresponding to a range of lowest loss values should be considered instead of only the subset producing the lowest loss value. The method can easily be extended to include fitting methods other than Procrustes rotations and other optimality criteria than the Procrustes loss employed here.},

abstract = {Individuals differ in the degree to which they attend to different sensory inputs of food when they make their judgments of overall liking. Foods are complex, so it is quite difficult to isolate the effect of any one sensory input without confounding with other sensory inputs. However, analytically one can begin to estimate the importance of a sensory input by the linear slope M, relating overall liking to sensory attribute liking [Overall Liking = M(Attribute Liking) + B]. On an individual-by-individual basis one can compute these slopes for appearance, taste/flavor, and texture, respectively, as well as the normalized slopes (defined as the attribute liking slope divided by the sum of the three attribute liking slopes). The approach is applied to six food product categories: bologna, hot dog, carbonated fruit beverage, blueberry pie filling, peanut butter, salad dressing. The results show substantial inter-individual variability in the way overall liking covaries with sensory attribute liking. On an aggregate basis for foods the rank of importance for attribute liking is taste/flavor, texture, and appearance, respectively. However, on an individual basis there are a variety of different patterns.},

The contribution of retronasal smell to perception of these metal salts at threshold has not been determined. Detection thresholds of the sulfate and chloride salts of ferrous iron and copper, and sodium chloride (as a control) were determined using a modified forced-choice ascending method of limits, with and without nasal occlusion. Threshold values were calculated from geometric means of individual estimates, and from interpolation on logistic regression and percent correct plots. Nasal occlusion raised thresholds for iron salts and copper but not sodium. The geometric mean detection thresholds with the nose open were 30, 64, 7.8, and 8.2 mu M for FeSO4, FeCl2, CUSO4, CUCl2, respectively but rose to 160, 227, 24.6 and 15.6 with the nose closed. Metal salts of both iron and copper create a retronasally perceived olfactory stimulus at low concentration levels, probably arising from lipid oxidation products generated in the mouth.
